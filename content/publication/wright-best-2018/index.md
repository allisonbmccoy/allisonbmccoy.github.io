abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Developing effective and reliable rule-based clinical decision
  support (CDS) alerts and reminders is challenging. Using a previously developed
  taxonomy for alert malfunctions, we identified best practices for developing, testing,
  implementing, and maintaining alerts and avoiding malfunctions. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  We identified 72 initial practices from the literature, interviews with subject
  matter experts, and prior research. To refine, enrich, and prioritize the list of
  practices, we used the Delphi method with two rounds of consensus-building and refinement.
  We used a larger than normal panel of experts to include a wide representation of
  CDS subject matter experts from various disciplines. RESULTS: 28 experts completed
  Round 1 and 25 completed Round 2. Round 1 narrowed the list to 47 best practices
  in 7 categories: knowledge management, designing and specifying, building, testing,
  deployment, monitoring and feedback, and people and governance. Round 2 developed
  consensus on the importance and feasibility of each best practice. DISCUSSION: The
  Delphi panel identified a range of best practices that may help to improve implementation
  of rule-based CDS and avert malfunctions. Due to limitations on resources and personnel,
  not everyone can implement all best practices. The most robust processes require
  investing in a data warehouse. Experts also pointed to the issue of shared responsibility
  between the healthcare organization and the electronic health record vendor. CONCLUSION:
  These 47 best practices represent an ideal situation. The research identifies the
  balance between importance and difficulty, highlights the challenges faced by organizations
  seeking to implement CDS, and describes several opportunities for future research
  to reduce alert malfunctions.'
