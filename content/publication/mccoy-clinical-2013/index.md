abstract: Clinical decision support (CDS) has been shown to improve clinical processes,
  promote patient safety, and reduce costs in healthcare settings, and it is now a
  requirement for clinicians as part of the Meaningful Use Regulation. However, most
  evidence for CDS has been evaluated primarily in internal medicine care settings,
  and colon and rectal surgery (CRS) has unique needs with CDS that are not frequently
  described in the literature. The authors reviewed published literature in informatics
  and medical journals, combined with expert opinion to define CDS, describe the evidence
  for CDS, outline the implementation process for CDS, and present applications of
  CDS in CRS.CDS functionalities such as order sets, documentation templates, and
  order facilitation aids are most often described in the literature and most likely
  to be beneficial in CRS. Further research is necessary to identify and better evaluate
  additional CDS systems in the setting of CRS.
