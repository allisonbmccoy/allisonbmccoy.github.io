abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Patients taking high doses of opioids, or taking opioids in
  combination with other central nervous system depressants, are at increased risk
  of opioid overdose. Coprescribing the opioid-reversal agent naloxone is an essential
  safety measure, recommended by the surgeon general, but the rate of naloxone coprescribing
  is low. Therefore, we set out to determine whether a targeted clinical decision
  support alert could increase the rate of naloxone coprescribing. METHODS: We conducted
  a before-after study from January 2019 to April 2021 at a large academic health
  system in the Southeast. We developed a targeted point of care decision support
  notification in the electronic health record to suggest ordering naloxone for patients
  who have a high risk of opioid overdose based on a high morphine equivalent daily
  dose (MEDD) â‰¥90 mg, concomitant benzodiazepine prescription, or a history of opioid
  use disorder or opioid overdose. We measured the rate of outpatient naloxone prescribing
  as our primary measure. A multivariable logistic regression model with robust variance
  to adjust for prescriptions within the same prescriber was implemented to estimate
  the association between alerts and naloxone coprescribing. RESULTS: The baseline
  naloxone coprescribing rate in 2019 was 0.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.31)
  naloxone prescriptions per 100 opioid prescriptions. After alert implementation,
  the naloxone coprescribing rate increased to 4.51 (95% CI, 4.33-4.68) naloxone prescriptions
  per 100 opioid prescriptions (P textless .001). The adjusted odds of naloxone coprescribing
  after alert implementation were approximately 28 times those during the baseline
  period (95% CI, 15-52). CONCLUSIONS: A targeted decision support alert for patients
  at risk for opioid overdose significantly increased the rate of naloxone coprescribing
  and was relatively easy to build.'
