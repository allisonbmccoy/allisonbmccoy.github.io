abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Clinical decision support (CDS), such as computerized alerts,
  improves prescribing in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), but considerable
  opportunity remains to improve patient safety. The authors sought to determine whether
  pharmacy surveillance of AKI patients could detect and prevent medication errors
  that are not corrected by automated interventions. METHODS: The authors conducted
  a randomized clinical trial among 396 patients admitted to an academic, tertiary
  care hospital between June 1, 2010 and August 31, 2010 with an acute 0.5 mg/dl change
  in serum creatinine over 48 hours and a nephrotoxic or renally cleared medication
  order. Patients randomly assigned to the intervention group received surveillance
  from a clinical pharmacist using a web-based surveillance tool to monitor drug prescribing
  and kidney function trends. CDS alerting and standard pharmacy services were active
  in both study arms. Outcome measures included blinded adjudication of potential
  adverse drug events (pADEs), adverse drug events (ADEs) and time to provider modification
  or discontinuation of targeted nephrotoxic or renally cleared medications. RESULTS:
  Potential ADEs or ADEs occurred for 104 (8.0%) of control and 99 (7.1%) of intervention
  patient-medication pairs (p=0.4). Additionally, the time to provider modification
  or discontinuation of targeted nephrotoxic or renally cleared medications did not
  differ between control and intervention patients (33.4 hrs vs. 30.3 hrs, p=0.3).
  CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy surveillance had no incremental benefit over previously implemented
  CDS alerts.'
