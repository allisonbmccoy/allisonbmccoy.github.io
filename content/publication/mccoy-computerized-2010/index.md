abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Frequently, prescribers fail to account for changing kidney
  function when prescribing medications. We evaluated the use of a computerized provider
  order entry intervention to improve medication management during acute kidney injury.
  STUDY DESIGN: Quality improvement report with time series analyses. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:
  1,598 adult inpatients with a minimum 0.5-mg/dL increase in serum creatinine level
  over 48 hours after an order for at least one of 122 nephrotoxic or renally cleared
  medications. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN: Passive noninteractive warnings about increasing
  serum creatinine level appeared within the computerized provider order entry interface
  and on printed rounding reports. For contraindicated or high-toxicity medications
  that should be avoided or adjusted, an interruptive alert within the system asked
  providers to modify or discontinue the targeted orders, mark the current dosing
  as correct and to remain unchanged, or defer the alert to reappear in the next session.
  OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Intervention effect on drug modification or discontinuation,
  time to modification or discontinuation, and provider interactions with alerts.
  RESULTS: The modification or discontinuation rate per 100 events for medications
  included in the interruptive alert within 24 hours of increasing creatinine level
  improved from 35.2 preintervention to 52.6 postintervention (P textless 0.001);
  orders were modified or discontinued more quickly (P textless 0.001). During the
  postintervention period, providers initially deferred 78.1% of interruptive alerts,
  although 54% of these eventually were modified or discontinued before patient death,
  discharge, or transfer. The response to passive alerts about medications requiring
  review did not significantly change compared with baseline. LIMITATIONS: Single
  tertiary-care academic medical center; provider actions were not independently adjudicated
  for appropriateness. CONCLUSIONS: A computerized provider order entry-based alerting
  system to support medication management after acute kidney injury significantly
  increased the rate and timeliness of modification or discontinuation of targeted
  medications.'
