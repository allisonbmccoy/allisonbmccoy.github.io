abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP)
  program seeks to conquer well-understood challenges in medical informatics through
  breakthrough research. Two SHARP centers have found alignment in their methodological
  needs: (1) members of the National Center for Cognitive Informatics and Decision-making
  (NCCD) have developed knowledge bases to support problem-oriented summarizations
  of patient data, and (2) Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technologies (SMART),
  which is a platform for reusable medical apps that can run on participating platforms
  connected to various electronic health records (EHR). Combining the work of these
  two centers will ensure wide dissemination of new methods for synthesized views
  of patient data. Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is an
  NIH-funded clinical research data repository platform in use at over 100 sites worldwide.
  By also working with a co-occurring initiative to SMART-enabling i2b2, we can confidently
  write one app that can be used extremely broadly. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to facilitate
  development of intuitive, problem-oriented views of the patient record using NCCD
  knowledge bases that would run in any EHR. To do this, we developed a collaboration
  between the two SHARPs and an NIH center, i2b2. METHODS: First, we implemented collaborative
  tools to connect researchers at three institutions. Next, we developed a patient
  summarization app using the SMART platform and a previously validated NCCD problem-medication
  linkage knowledge base derived from the National Drug File-Reference Terminology
  (NDF-RT). Finally, to SMART-enable i2b2, we implemented two new Web service \"cells\"
  that expose the SMART application programming interface (API), and we made changes
  to the Web interface of i2b2 to host a \"carousel\" of SMART apps. RESULTS: We deployed
  our SMART-based, NDF-RT-derived patient summarization app in this SMART-i2b2 container.
  It displays a problem-oriented view of medications and presents a line-graph display
  of laboratory results. CONCLUSIONS: This summarization app can be run in any EHR
  environment that either supports SMART or runs SMART-enabled i2b2. This i2b2 \"clinical
  bridge\" demonstrates a pathway for reusable app development that does not require
  EHR vendors to immediately adopt the SMART API. Apps can be developed in SMART and
  run by clinicians in the i2b2 repository, reusing clinical data extracted from EHRs.
  This may encourage the adoption of SMART by supporting SMART app development until
  EHRs adopt the platform. It also allows a new variety of clinical SMART apps, fueled
  by the broad aggregation of data types available in research repositories. The app
  (including its knowledge base) and SMART-i2b2 are open-source and freely available
  for download.'
