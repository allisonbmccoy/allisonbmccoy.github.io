abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Clinical decision support (CDS) is essential for delivery of
  high-quality, cost-effective, and safe healthcare. The authors sought to evaluate
  the CDS capabilities across electronic health record (EHR) systems. METHODS: We
  evaluated the CDS implementation capabilities of 8 Office of the National Coordinator
  for Health Information Technology Authorized Certification Body (ONC-ACB)-certified
  EHRs. Within each EHR, the authors attempted to implement 3 user-defined rules that
  utilized the various data and logic elements expected of typical EHRs and that represented
  clinically important evidenced-based care. The rules were: 1) if a patient has amiodarone
  on his or her active medication list and does not have a thyroid-stimulating hormone
  (TSH) result recorded in the last 12 months, suggest ordering a TSH; 2) if a patient
  has a hemoglobin A1c result textgreater7% and does not have diabetes on his or her
  problem list, suggest adding diabetes to the problem list; and 3) if a patient has
  coronary artery disease on his or her problem list and does not have aspirin on
  the active medication list, suggest ordering aspirin. RESULTS: Most evaluated EHRs
  lacked some CDS capabilities; 5 EHRs were able to implement all 3 rules, and the
  remaining 3 EHRs were unable to implement any of the rules. One of these did not
  allow users to customize CDS rules at all. The most frequently found shortcomings
  included the inability to use laboratory test results in rules, limit rules by time,
  use advanced Boolean logic, perform actions from the alert interface, and adequately
  test rules. CONCLUSION: Significant improvements in the EHR certification and implementation
  procedures are necessary.'
