abstract: 'Clinical databases may contain several records for a single patient. Multiple
  general entity-resolution algorithms have been developed to identify such duplicate
  records. To achieve optimal accuracy, algorithm parameters must be tuned to a particular
  dataset. The purpose of this study was to determine the required training set size
  for probabilistic, deterministic and Fuzzy Inference Engine (FIE) algorithms with
  parameters optimized using the particle swarm approach. Each algorithm classified
  potential duplicates into: definite match, non-match and indeterminate (i.e., requires
  manual review). Training sets size ranged from 2,000-10,000 randomly selected record-pairs.
  We also evaluated marginal uncertainty sampling for active learning. Optimization
  reduced manual review size (Deterministic 11.6% vs. 2.5%; FIE 49.6% vs. 1.9%; and
  Probabilistic 10.5% vs. 3.5%). FIE classified 98.1% of the records correctly (precision=1.0).
  Best performance required training on all 10,000 randomly-selected record-pairs.
  Active learning achieved comparable results with 3,000 records. Automated optimization
  is effective and targeted sampling can reduce the required training set size.'
