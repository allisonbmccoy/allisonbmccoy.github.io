abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Correlation of data within electronic health records is necessary
  for implementation of various clinical decision support functions, including patient
  summarization. A key type of correlation is linking medications to clinical problems;
  while some databases of problem-medication links are available, they are not robust
  and depend on problems and medications being encoded in particular terminologies.
  Crowdsourcing represents one approach to generating robust knowledge bases across
  a variety of terminologies, but more sophisticated approaches are necessary to improve
  accuracy and reduce manual data review requirements. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop
  and evaluate a clinician reputation metric to facilitate the identification of appropriate
  problem-medication pairs through crowdsourcing without requiring extensive manual
  review. APPROACH: We retrieved medications from our clinical data warehouse that
  had been prescribed and manually linked to one or more problems by clinicians during
  e-prescribing between June 1, 2010 and May 31, 2011. We identified measures likely
  to be associated with the percentage of accurate problem-medication links made by
  clinicians. Using logistic regression, we created a metric for identifying clinicians
  who had made greater than or equal to 95% appropriate links. We evaluated the accuracy
  of the approach by comparing links made by those physicians identified as having
  appropriate links to a previously manually validated subset of problem-medication
  pairs. RESULTS: Of 867 clinicians who asserted a total of 237,748 problem-medication
  links during the study period, 125 had a reputation metric that predicted the percentage
  of appropriate links greater than or equal to 95%. These clinicians asserted a total
  of 2464 linked problem-medication pairs (983 distinct pairs). Compared to a previously
  validated set of problem-medication pairs, the reputation metric achieved a specificity
  of 99.5% and marginally improved the sensitivity of previously described knowledge
  bases. CONCLUSION: A reputation metric may be a valuable measure for identifying
  high quality clinician-entered, crowdsourced data.'
