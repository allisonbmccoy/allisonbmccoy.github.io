abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an approach that identifies patients
  eligible for lung cancer screening (LCS) by combining structured and unstructured
  smoking data from the electronic health record (EHR). METHODS: We identified patients
  aged 50-80 years who had at least one encounter in a primary care clinic at Vanderbilt
  University Medical Center (VUMC) between 2019 and 2022. We fine-tuned an existing
  natural language processing (NLP) tool to extract quantitative smoking information
  using clinical notes collected from VUMC. Then, we developed an approach to identify
  patients who are eligible for LCS by combining smoking information from structured
  data and clinical narratives. We compared this method with two approaches to identify
  LCS eligibility only using smoking information from structured EHR. We used 50 patients
  with a documented history of tobacco use for comparison and validation. RESULTS:
  102,475 patients were included. The NLP-based approach achieved an F1-score of 0.909,
  and accuracy of 0.96. The baseline approach could identify 5,887 patients. Compared
  to the baseline approach, the number of identified patients using all structured
  data and the NLP-based algorithm was 7,194 (22.2 %) and 10,231 (73.8 %), respectively.
  The NLP-based approach identified 589 Black/African Americans, a significant increase
  of 119 %. CONCLUSION: We present a feasible NLP-based approach to identify LCS eligible
  patients. It provides a technical basis for the development of clinical decision
  support tools to potentially improve the utilization of LCS and diminish healthcare
  disparities.'
