abstract: Developing a diverse informatics workforce broadens the research agenda
  and ensures the growth of innovative solutions that enable equity-centered care.
  The American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) established the AMIA First Look
  Program in 2017 to address workforce disparities among women, including those from
  marginalized communities. The program exposes women to informatics, furnishes mentors,
  and provides career resources. In 4 years, the program has introduced 87 undergraduate
  women, 41% members of marginalized communities, to informatics. Participants from
  the 2019 and 2020 cohorts reported interest in pursuing a career in informatics
  increased from 57% to 86% after participation, and 86% of both years' attendees
  responded that they would recommend the program to others. A June 2021 LinkedIn
  profile review found 50% of participants working in computer science or informatics,
  4% pursuing informatics graduate degrees, and 32% having completed informatics internships,
  suggesting AMIA First Look has the potential to increase informatics diversity.
