abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To determine if ChatGPT can generate useful suggestions for
  improving clinical decision support (CDS) logic and to assess noninferiority compared
  to human-generated suggestions. METHODS: We supplied summaries of CDS logic to ChatGPT,
  an artificial intelligence (AI) tool for question answering that uses a large language
  model, and asked it to generate suggestions. We asked human clinician reviewers
  to review the AI-generated suggestions as well as human-generated suggestions for
  improving the same CDS alerts, and rate the suggestions for their usefulness, acceptance,
  relevance, understanding, workflow, bias, inversion, and redundancy. RESULTS: Five
  clinicians analyzed 36 AI-generated suggestions and 29 human-generated suggestions
  for 7 alerts. Of the 20 suggestions that scored highest in the survey, 9 were generated
  by ChatGPT. The suggestions generated by AI were found to offer unique perspectives
  and were evaluated as highly understandable and relevant, with moderate usefulness,
  low acceptance, bias, inversion, redundancy. CONCLUSION: AI-generated suggestions
  could be an important complementary part of optimizing CDS alerts, can identify
  potential improvements to alert logic and support their implementation, and may
  even be able to assist experts in formulating their own suggestions for CDS improvement.
  ChatGPT shows great potential for using large language models and reinforcement
  learning from human feedback to improve CDS alert logic and potentially other medical
  areas involving complex, clinical logic, a key step in the development of an advanced
  learning health system.'
