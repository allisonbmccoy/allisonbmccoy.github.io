abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Documentation burden is a common problem with modern electronic
  health record (EHR) systems. To reduce this burden, various recording methods (eg,
  voice recorders or motion sensors) have been proposed. However, these solutions
  are in an early prototype phase and are unlikely to transition into practice in
  the near future. A more pragmatic alternative is to directly modify the implementation
  of the existing functionalities of an EHR system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to
  assess the nature of free-text comments entered into EHR flowsheets that supplement
  quantitative vital sign values and examine opportunities to simplify functionality
  and reduce documentation burden. METHODS: We evaluated 209,055 vital sign comments
  in flowsheets that were generated in the Epic EHR system at the Vanderbilt University
  Medical Center in 2018. We applied topic modeling, as well as the natural language
  processing Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing software system,
  to extract generally discussed topics and detailed medical terms (expressed as probability
  distribution) to investigate the stories communicated in these comments. RESULTS:
  Our analysis showed that 63.33% (6053/9557) of the users who entered vital signs
  made at least one free-text comment in vital sign flowsheet entries. The user roles
  that were most likely to compose comments were registered nurse, technician, and
  licensed nurse. The most frequently identified topics were the notification of a
  result to health care providers (0.347), the context of a measurement (0.307), and
  an inability to obtain a vital sign (0.224). There were 4187 unique medical terms
  that were extracted from 46,029 (0.220) comments, including many symptom-related
  terms such as \"pain,\" \"upset,\" \"dizziness,\" \"coughing,\" \"anxiety,\" \"distress,\"
  and \"fever\" and drug-related terms such as \"tylenol,\" \"anesthesia,\" \"cannula,\"
  \"oxygen,\" \"motrin,\" \"rituxan,\" and \"labetalol.\" CONCLUSIONS: Considering
  that flowsheet comments are generally not displayed or automatically pulled into
  any clinical notes, our findings suggest that the flowsheet comment functionality
  can be simplified (eg, via structured response fields instead of a text input dialog)
  to reduce health care provider effort. Moreover, rich and clinically important medical
  terms such as medications and symptoms should be explicitly recorded in clinical
  notes for better visibility.'
