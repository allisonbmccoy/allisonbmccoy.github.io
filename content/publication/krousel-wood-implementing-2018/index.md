abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: We assessed changes in the percentage of providers with positive
  perceptions of electronic health record (EHR) benefit before and after transition
  from a local basic to a commercial comprehensive EHR. METHODS: Changes in the percentage
  of providers with positive perceptions of EHR benefit were captured via a survey
  of academic health care providers before (baseline) and at 6-12 months (short term)
  and 12-24 months (long term) after the transition. We analyzed 32 items for the
  overall group and by practice setting, provider age, and specialty using separate
  multivariable-adjusted random effects logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total
  of 223 providers completed all 3 surveys (30% response rate): 85.6% had outpatient
  practices, 56.5% were textgreater45 years old, and 23.8% were primary care providers.
  The percentage of providers with positive perceptions significantly increased from
  baseline to long-term follow-up for patient communication, hospital transitions
  - access to clinical information, preventive care delivery, preventive care prompt,
  preventive lab prompt, satisfaction with system reliability, and sharing medical
  information (P textless .05 for each). The percentage of providers with positive
  perceptions significantly decreased over time for overall satisfaction, productivity,
  better patient care, clinical decision quality, easy access to patient information,
  monitoring patients, more time for patients, coordination of care, computer access,
  adequate resources, and satisfaction with ease of use (P textless 0.05 for each).
  Results varied by subgroup. CONCLUSION: After a transition to a commercial comprehensive
  EHR, items with significant increases and significant decreases in the percentage
  of providers with positive perceptions of EHR benefit were identified, overall and
  by subgroup.'
