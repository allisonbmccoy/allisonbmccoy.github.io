 abstract = {Pneumonia is the most frequent cause of infectious disease-related deaths in children worldwide. Clinical decision support (CDS) applications can guide appropriate treatment, but the system must first recognize the appropriate diagnosis. To enable CDS for pediatric pneumonia, we developed an algorithm integrating natural language processing (NLP) and random forest classifiers to identify potential pediatric pneumonia from radiology reports. We deployed the algorithm in the EHR of a large children's hospital using real-time NLP. We describe the development and deployment of the algorithm, and evaluate our approach using 9-months of data gathered while the system was in use. Our model, trained on individual radiology reports, had an AUC of 0.954. The intervention, evaluated on patient encounters that could include multiple radiology reports, achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of0.899, 0.949, and 0.781, respectively.},
