abstract: Pneumonia is the most frequent cause of infectious disease-related deaths
  in children worldwide. Clinical decision support (CDS) applications can guide appropriate
  treatment, but the system must first recognize the appropriate diagnosis. To enable
  CDS for pediatric pneumonia, we developed an algorithm integrating natural language
  processing (NLP) and random forest classifiers to identify potential pediatric pneumonia
  from radiology reports. We deployed the algorithm in the EHR of a large children's
  hospital using real-time NLP. We describe the development and deployment of the
  algorithm, and evaluate our approach using 9-months of data gathered while the system
  was in use. Our model, trained on individual radiology reports, had an AUC of 0.954.
  The intervention, evaluated on patient encounters that could include multiple radiology
  reports, achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of0.899,
  0.949, and 0.781, respectively.
