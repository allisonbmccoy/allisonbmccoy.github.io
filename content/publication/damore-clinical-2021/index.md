abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Accurate and robust quality measurement is critical to the future
  of value-based care. Having incomplete information when calculating quality measures
  can cause inaccuracies in reported patient outcomes. This research examines how
  quality calculations vary when using data from an individual electronic health record
  (EHR) and longitudinal data from a health information exchange (HIE) operating as
  a multisource registry for quality measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were
  sampled from 53 healthcare organizations in 2018. Organizations represented both
  ambulatory care practices and health systems participating in the state of Kansas
  HIE. Fourteen ambulatory quality measures for 5300 patients were calculated using
  the data from an individual EHR source and contrasted to calculations when HIE data
  were added to locally recorded data. RESULTS: A total of 79% of patients received
  care at more than 1 facility during the 2018 calendar year. A total of 12 994 applicable
  quality measure calculations were compared using data from the originating organization
  vs longitudinal data from the HIE. A total of 15% of all quality measure calculations
  changed (P textless .001) when including HIE data sources, affecting 19% of patients.
  Changes in quality measure calculations were observed across measures and organizations.
  DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that quality measures calculated using single-site
  EHR data may be limited by incomplete information. Effective data sharing significantly
  changes quality calculations, which affect healthcare payments, patient safety,
  and care quality. CONCLUSIONS: Federal, state, and commercial programs that use
  quality measurement as part of reimbursement could promote more accurate and representative
  quality measurement through methods that increase clinical data sharing.'
