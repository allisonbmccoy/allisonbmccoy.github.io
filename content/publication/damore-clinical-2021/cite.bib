 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Accurate and robust quality measurement is critical to the future of value-based care. Having incomplete information when calculating quality measures can cause inaccuracies in reported patient outcomes. This research examines how quality calculations vary when using data from an individual electronic health record (EHR) and longitudinal data from a health information exchange (HIE) operating as a multisource registry for quality measurement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were sampled from 53 healthcare organizations in 2018. Organizations represented both ambulatory care practices and health systems participating in the state of Kansas HIE. Fourteen ambulatory quality measures for 5300 patients were calculated using the data from an individual EHR source and contrasted to calculations when HIE data were added to locally recorded data.
RESULTS: A total of 79% of patients received care at more than 1 facility during the 2018 calendar year. A total of 12 994 applicable quality measure calculations were compared using data from the originating organization vs longitudinal data from the HIE. A total of 15% of all quality measure calculations changed (P \textless .001) when including HIE data sources, affecting 19% of patients. Changes in quality measure calculations were observed across measures and organizations.
DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that quality measures calculated using single-site EHR data may be limited by incomplete information. Effective data sharing significantly changes quality calculations, which affect healthcare payments, patient safety, and care quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Federal, state, and commercial programs that use quality measurement as part of reimbursement could promote more accurate and representative quality measurement through methods that increase clinical data sharing.},
