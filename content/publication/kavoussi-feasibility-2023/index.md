abstract: "This study seeks to evaluate the recurrence of kidney stones (ROKS) nomogram
  for risk stratification of recurrence in a retrospective study. To do this, we analyzed
  the performance of the 2018 ROKS nomogram in a case-control study of 200 patients
  (100 with and 100 without subsequent recurrence). All patients underwent kidney
  stone surgery between 2013 and 2015 and had at least 5 years of follow-up. We evaluated
  ROKS performance for prediction of recurrence at 2- and 5-year via area under the
  receiver operating curve (ROC-AUC). Specifically, we assessed the nomogram's potential
  for stratifying patients based on low or high risk of recurrence at: a) an optimized
  cutoff threshold (i.e., optimized for both sensitivity and specificity), and b)
  a sensitive cutoff threshold (i.e., high sensitivity (0.80) and low specificity).
  We found fair performance of the nomogram for recurrence prediction at 2 and 5 years
  (ROC-AUC of 0.67 and 0.63, respectively). At the optimized cutoff threshold, recurrence
  rates for the low and high-risk groups were 20 and 45% at 2 years, and 50 and 70%
  at 5 years, respectively. At the sensitive cutoff threshold, the corresponding recurrence
  rates for the low and high-risk groups were of 16 and 38% at 2 years, and 42 and
  66% at 5 years, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a recurrence-free advantage
  between the groups for both cutoff thresholds (p textless 0.01, Fig. 2). Therefore,
  we believe that the ROKS nomogram could facilitate risk stratification for stone
  recurrence and adherence to risk-based surveillance protocols."
