abstract: "BACKGROUND: Effective teaching of evidence-based medicine (EBM) to medical
  students is important for lifelong self-directed learning. AIMS: We implemented
  a brief workshop designed to teach literature searching skills to third-year medical
  students. We assessed its impact on students' utilization of EBM resources during
  their clinical rotation and the quality of EBM integration in inpatient notes. METHODS:
  We developed a physician-led, hands-on workshop to introduce EBM resources to all
  internal medicine clerks. Pre- and post-workshop measures included student's attitudes
  to EBM, citations of EBM resources in their clinical notes, and quality of the EBM
  component of the discussion in the note. Computer log analysis recorded students'
  online search attempts. RESULTS: After the workshop, students reported improved
  comfort using EBM and increased utilization of EBM resources. EBM integration into
  the discussion component of the notes also showed significant improvement. Computer
  log analysis of students' searches demonstrated increased utilization of EBM resources
  following the workshop. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the successful implementation of
  a workshop designed to teach third-year medical students how to perform an efficient
  EBM literature search. We demonstrated improvements in students' confidence regarding
  EBM, increased utilization of EBM resources, and improved integration of EBM into
  inpatient notes."
