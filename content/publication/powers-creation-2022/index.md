abstract: 'Many health systems have joined the Age-Friendly Health Systems movement
  to provide every older adult safe, high-quality care aligned with what matters most.
  Becoming an Age-Friendly Health System means that hospitals and health care systems
  reliably use a set of evidence-based practices known as the “4M’s” – What Matters,
  Medication, Mentation, and Mobility – to provide care for older, disabled and medically
  complex patients across all care settings. Implementing the Institute for Healthcare
  Improvement’s (IHI) 4M’s Age-Friendly principles into primary care is challenging
  because there is no best practice to identify documentation of delivery. Leveraging
  the electronic health record (EHR) may automate this process. Age-Friendly principles
  for primary care were discussed at IHI peer coaching webinars, and PDSA cycles employed
  among clinic staff to define each of the 4M’s for the Vanderbilt Geriatric Practice:
  1) Mentation – Mini-COG and PHQ2 extracted from nursing intake, 2) Medication –
  extracted from medication review, provider reconciliation, 3) Mobility – extracted
  from activities of daily living (ADL) mobility questions in nursing intake, and
  4) What Matters Most – identifying patient portal messages. A dashboard within our
  EPIC electronic health record (EHR) was built based on these identified fields,
  allowing clinician drill-down to display more detail as needed. An operational dashboard
  for an EHR has potential to help inform clinician delivery of 4M’s care in the primary
  care setting.'
