 abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current state of problem list maintenance at an academic medical center.
SUMMARY: We included problem list data for patients who had at least 2 face-to-face encounters at Vanderbilt University Medical Center or its clinics between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. We used the frequency of problem list additions, resolutions, deletions, duplicate problems (exact and SNOMED CT duplicates), inconsistencies (contradicting stages of disease state), and items that could be documented elsewhere in the electronic health record as surrogate markers of problem list maintenance. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results. A total of 546,510 patients met inclusion criteria. There were 3,762 (0.7%) patients who had the exact same active problem listed more than once. SNOMED CT code duplications occurred in the records for 56,399 (10.5%) patients. Of the patients with asthma, 2.5% (223/8,779) had contradicting asthma stages active on their problem list, and 6.4% (950/14,950) of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had contradicting CKD stages. In addition, 17,205 (3.1%) patients had 20,365 active family history problems and 39,464 (7.2%) patients had an allergy documented on their problem list. On average, there were 43.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 14-73.4) additions, 8.7 (95% CI, 0.1-17.4) resolutions, and 2.1 (95% CI, 0-4.6) deletions of problems per 100 face-to-face encounters, inpatient or outpatient.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests areas for improvement for problem list maintenance. Further studies into semantic duplication and clinical decision support tools to encourage problem list maintenance and deduplication are needed.},
