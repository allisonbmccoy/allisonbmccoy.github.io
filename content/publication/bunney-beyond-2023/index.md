abstract: "BACKGROUND: Chest pain (CP) is the hallmark symptom for acute coronary
  syndrome (ACS) but is not reported in 20-30% of patients, especially women, elderly,
  non-white patients, presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an ST-segment
  elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). METHODS: We used a retrospective 5-year
  adult ED sample of 279,132 patients to explore using CP alone to predict ACS, then
  we incrementally added other ACS chief complaints, age, and sex in a series of multivariable
  logistic regression models. We evaluated each model's identification of ACS and
  STEMI. RESULTS: Using CP alone would recommend ECGs for 8% of patients (sensitivity,
  61%; specificity, 92%) but missed 28.4% of STEMIs. The model with all variables
  identified ECGs for 22% of patients (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 78%) but missed
  14.7% of STEMIs. The model with CP and other ACS chief complaints had the highest
  sensitivity (93%) and specificity (55%), identified 45.1% of patients for ECG, and
  only missed 4.4% of STEMIs. CONCLUSION: CP alone had highest specificity but lacked
  sensitivity. Adding other ACS chief complaints increased sensitivity but identified
  2.2-fold more patients for ECGs. Achieving an ECG in 10Â min for patients with ACS
  to identify all STEMIs will be challenging without introducing more complex risk
  calculation into clinical care."
