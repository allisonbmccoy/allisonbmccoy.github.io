abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The impact of AKI on adverse drug events and
  therapeutic failures and the medication errors leading to these events have not
  been well described. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A single-center
  observational study of 396 hospitalized patients with a minimum 0.5 mg/dl change
  in serum creatinine who were prescribed a nephrotoxic or renally eliminated medication
  was conducted. The population was stratified into two groups by the direction of
  their initial serum creatinine change: AKI and AKI recovery. Adverse drug events,
  potential adverse drug events, therapeutic failures, and potential therapeutic failures
  for 148 drugs and 46 outcomes were retrospectively measured. Events were classified
  for preventability and severity by expert adjudication. Multivariable analysis identified
  medication classes predisposing AKI patients to adverse drug events. RESULTS: Forty-three
  percent of patients experienced a potential adverse drug event, adverse drug event,
  therapeutic failure, or potential therapeutic failure; 66% of study events were
  preventable. Failure to adjust for kidney function (63%) and use of nephrotoxic
  medications during AKI (28%) were the most common potential adverse drug events.
  Worsening AKI and hypotension were the most common preventable adverse drug events.
  Most adverse drug events were considered serious (63%) or life-threatening (31%),
  with one fatal adverse drug event. Among AKI patients, administration of angiotensin-converting
  enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, antibiotics, and antithrombotics
  was most strongly associated with the development of an adverse drug event or potential
  adverse drug event. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug events and potential therapeutic failures
  are common and frequently severe in patients with AKI exposed to nephrotoxic or
  renally eliminated medications.'
