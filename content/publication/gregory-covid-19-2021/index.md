abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To quantify and contextualize the risk for coronavirus disease
  2019 (COVID-19)-related hospitalization and illness severity in type 1 diabetes.
  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study to identify
  case subjects with COVID-19 across a regional health care network of 137 service
  locations. Using an electronic health record query, chart review, and patient contact,
  we identified clinical factors influencing illness severity. RESULTS: We identified
  COVID-19 in 6,138, 40, and 273 patients without diabetes and with type 1 and type
  2 diabetes, respectively. Compared with not having diabetes, people with type 1
  diabetes had adjusted odds ratios of 3.90 (95% CI 1.75-8.69) for hospitalization
  and 3.35 (95% CI 1.53-7.33) for greater illness severity, which was similar to risk
  in type 2 diabetes. Among patients with type 1 diabetes, glycosylated hemoglobin
  (HbA1c), hypertension, race, recent diabetic ketoacidosis, health insurance status,
  and less diabetes technology use were significantly associated with illness severity.
  CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes status, both type 1 and type 2, independently increases the
  adverse impacts of COVID-19. Potentially modifiable factors (e.g., HbA1c) had significant
  but modest impact compared with comparatively static factors (e.g., race and insurance)
  in type 1 diabetes, indicating an urgent and continued need to mitigate severe acute
  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection risk in this community.'
