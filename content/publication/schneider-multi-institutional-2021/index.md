abstract: '(1) Background: Clinical decision support (CDS) is a vitally important
  adjunct to the implementation of pharmacogenomic-guided prescribing in clinical
  practice. A novel CDS was sought for the APOL1, NAT2, and YEATS4 genes to guide
  optimal selection of antihypertensive medications among the African American population
  cared for at multiple participating institutions in a clinical trial. (2) Methods:
  The CDS committee, made up of clinical content and CDS experts, developed a framework
  and contributed to the creation of the CDS using the following guiding principles:
  1. medical algorithm consensus; 2. actionability; 3. context-sensitive triggers;
  4. workflow integration; 5. feasibility; 6. interpretability; 7. portability; and
  8. discrete reporting of lab results. (3) Results: Utilizing the principle of discrete
  patient laboratory and vital information, a novel CDS for APOL1, NAT2, and YEATS4
  was created for use in a multi-institutional trial based on a medical algorithm
  consensus. The alerts are actionable and easily interpretable, clearly displaying
  the purpose and recommendations with pertinent laboratory results, vitals and links
  to ordersets with suggested antihypertensive dosages. Alerts were either triggered
  immediately once a provider starts to order relevant antihypertensive agents or
  strategically placed in workflow-appropriate general CDS sections in the electronic
  health record (EHR). Detailed implementation instructions were shared across institutions
  to achieve maximum portability. (4) Conclusions: Using sound principles, the created
  genetic algorithms were applied across multiple institutions. The framework outlined
  in this study should apply to other disease-gene and pharmacogenomic projects employing
  CDS.'
