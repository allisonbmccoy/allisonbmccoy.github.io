abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To improve clinical decision support (CDS) by allowing users
  to provide real-time feedback when they interact with CDS tools and by creating
  processes for responding to and acting on this feedback. METHODS: Two organizations
  implemented similar real-time feedback tools and processes in their electronic health
  record and gathered data over a 30-month period. At both sites, users could provide
  feedback by using Likert feedback links embedded in all end-user facing alerts,
  with results stored outside the electronic health record, and provide feedback as
  a comment when they overrode an alert. Both systems are monitored daily by clinical
  informatics teams. RESULTS: The two sites received 2,639 Likert feedback comments
  and 623,270 override comments over a 30-month period. Through four case studies,
  we describe our use of end-user feedback to rapidly respond to build errors, as
  well as identifying inaccurate knowledge management, user-interface issues, and
  unique workflows. CONCLUSION: Feedback on CDS tools can be solicited in multiple
  ways, and it contains valuable and actionable suggestions to improve CDS alerts.
  Additionally, end users appreciate knowing their feedback is being received and
  may also make other suggestions to improve the electronic health record. Incorporation
  of end-user feedback into CDS monitoring, evaluation, and remediation is a way to
  improve CDS.'
