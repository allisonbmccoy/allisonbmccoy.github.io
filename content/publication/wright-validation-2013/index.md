abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In a prior study, we developed methods for automatically identifying
  associations between medications and problems using association rule mining on a
  large clinical data warehouse and validated these methods at a single site which
  used a self-developed electronic health record. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the generalizability
  of these methods by validating them at an external site. METHODS: We received data
  on medications and problems for 263,597 patients from the University of Texas Health
  Science Center at Houston Faculty Practice, an ambulatory practice that uses the
  Allscripts Enterprise commercial electronic health record product. We then conducted
  association rule mining to identify associated pairs of medications and problems
  and characterized these associations with five measures of interestingness: support,
  confidence, chi-square, interest and conviction and compared the top-ranked pairs
  to a gold standard. RESULTS: 25,088 medication-problem pairs were identified that
  exceeded our confidence and support thresholds. An analysis of the top 500 pairs
  according to each measure of interestingness showed a high degree of accuracy for
  highly-ranked pairs. CONCLUSION: The same technique was successfully employed at
  the University of Texas and accuracy was comparable to our previous results. Top
  associations included many medications that are highly specific for a particular
  problem as well as a large number of common, accurate medication-problem pairs that
  reflect practice patterns.'
