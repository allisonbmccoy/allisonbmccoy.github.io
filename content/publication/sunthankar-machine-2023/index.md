abstract: There is high risk of mortality between stage I and stage II palliation
  of single ventricle heart disease. This study aimed to leverage advanced machine
  learning algorithms to optimize risk-prediction models and identify features most
  predictive of interstage mortality. This study utilized retrospective data from
  the National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative and included
  all patients who underwent stage I palliation and survived to hospital discharge
  (2008-2019). Multiple machine learning models were evaluated, including logistic
  regression, random forest, gradient boosting trees, extreme gradient boost trees,
  and light gradient boosting machines. A total of 3267 patients were included with
  208 (6.4%) interstage deaths. Machine learning models were trained on 180 clinical
  features. Digoxin use at discharge was the most influential factor resulting in
  a lower risk of interstage mortality (p textless 0.0001). Stage I surgery with Blalock-Taussig-Thomas
  shunt portended higher risk than Sano conduit (7.8% vs 4.4%, p = 0.0002). Non-modifiable
  risk factors identified with increased risk of interstage mortality included female
  sex, lower gestational age, and lower birth weight. Post-operative risk factors
  included the requirement of unplanned catheterization and more severe atrioventricular
  valve insufficiency at discharge. Light gradient boosting machines demonstrated
  the best performance with an area under the receiver operative characteristic curve
  of 0.642. Advanced machine learning algorithms highlight a number of modifiable
  and non-modifiable risk factors for interstage mortality following stage I palliation.
  However, model performance remains modest, suggesting the presence of unmeasured
  confounders that contribute to interstage risk.
