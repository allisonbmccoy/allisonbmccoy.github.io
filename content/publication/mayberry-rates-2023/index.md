abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Clinical trials indicate continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use
  may benefit adults with type 2 diabetes, but CGM rates and correlates in real-world
  care settings are unknown. OBJECTIVE: We sought to ascertain prevalence and correlates
  of CGM use and to examine rates of new CGM prescriptions across clinic types and
  medication regimens. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort using electronic health records
  in a large academic medical center in the Southeastern US. PARTICIPANTS: Adults
  with type 2 diabetes and a primary care or endocrinology visit during 2021. MAIN
  MEASURES: Age, gender, race, ethnicity, insurance, clinic type, insulin regimen,
  hemoglobin A1c values, CGM prescriptions, and prescribing clinic type. KEY RESULTS:
  Among 30,585 adults with type 2 diabetes, 13% had used a CGM. CGM users were younger
  and more had private health insurance (p textless .05) as compared to non-users;
  72% of CGM users had an intensive insulin regimen, but 12% were not taking insulin.
  CGM users had higher hemoglobin A1c values (both most recent and most proximal to
  the first CGM prescription) than non-users. CGM users were more likely to receive
  endocrinology care than non-users, but 23% had only primary care visits in 2021.
  For each month in 2021, a mean of 90.5 (SD 12.5) people started using CGM. From
  2020 to 2021, monthly rates of CGM prescriptions to new users grew 36% overall,
  but 125% in primary care. Most starting CGM in endocrinology had an intensive insulin
  regimen (82% vs. 49% starting in primary care), whereas 28% starting CGM in primary
  care were not using insulin (vs. 5% in endocrinology). CONCLUSION: CGM uptake for
  type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly, with most growth in primary care. These trends
  present opportunities for healthcare system adaptations to support CGM use and related
  workflows in primary care to support growth in uptake.'
