abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Clinical knowledge bases of problem-medication pairs are necessary
  for many informatics solutions that improve patient safety, such as clinical summarization.
  However, developing these knowledge bases can be challenging. OBJECTIVE: We sought
  to validate a previously developed crowdsourcing approach for generating a knowledge
  base of problem-medication pairs in a large, non-university health care system with
  a widely used, commercially available electronic health record. METHODS: We first
  retrieved medications and problems entered in the electronic health record by clinicians
  during routine care during a six month study period. Following the previously published
  approach, we calculated the link frequency and link ratio for each pair then identified
  a threshold cutoff for estimated problem-medication pair appropriateness through
  clinician review; problem-medication pairs meeting the threshold were included in
  the resulting knowledge base. We selected 50 medications and their gold standard
  indications to compare the resulting knowledge base to the pilot knowledge base
  developed previously and determine its recall and precision. RESULTS: The resulting
  knowledge base contained 26,912 pairs, had a recall of 62.3% and a precision of
  87.5%, and outperformed the pilot knowledge base containing 11,167 pairs from the
  previous study, which had a recall of 46.9% and a precision of 83.3%. CONCLUSIONS:
  We validated the crowdsourcing approach for generating a knowledge base of problem-medication
  pairs in a large non-university health care system with a widely used, commercially
  available electronic health record, indicating that the approach may be generalizable
  across healthcare settings and clinical systems. Further research is necessary to
  better evaluate the knowledge, to compare crowdsourcing with other approaches, and
  to evaluate if incorporating the knowledge into electronic health records improves
  patient outcomes.'
