abstract: "OBJECTIVE: Clinical summarization, the process by which relevant patient
  information is electronically summarized and presented at the point of care, is
  of increasing importance given the increasing volume of clinical data in electronic
  health record systems (EHRs). There is a paucity of research on electronic clinical
  summarization, including the capabilities of currently available EHR systems. METHODS:
  We compared different aspects of general clinical summary screens used in twelve
  different EHR systems using a previously described conceptual model: AORTIS (Aggregation,
  Organization, Reduction, Interpretation and Synthesis). RESULTS: We found a wide
  variation in the EHRs' summarization capabilities: all systems were capable of simple
  aggregation and organization of limited clinical content, but only one demonstrated
  an ability to synthesize information from the data. CONCLUSION: Improvement of the
  clinical summary screen functionality for currently available EHRs is necessary.
  Further research should identify strategies and methods for creating easy to use,
  well-designed clinical summary screens that aggregate, organize and reduce all pertinent
  patient information as well as provide clinical interpretations and synthesis as
  required."
