abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To try to lower patient re-identification risks for biomedical
  research databases containing laboratory test results while also minimizing changes
  in clinical data interpretation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our threat model, an
  attacker obtains 5-7 laboratory results from one patient and uses them as a search
  key to discover the corresponding record in a de-identified biomedical research
  database. To test our models, the existing Vanderbilt TIME database of 8.5 million
  Safe Harbor de-identified laboratory results from 61â€ˆ280 patients was used. The
  uniqueness of unaltered laboratory results in the dataset was examined, and then
  two data perturbation models were applied-simple random offsets and an expert-derived
  clinical meaning-preserving model. A rank-based re-identification algorithm to mimic
  an attack was used. The re-identification risk and the retention of clinical meaning
  for each model's perturbed laboratory results were assessed. RESULTS: Differences
  in re-identification rates between the algorithms were small despite substantial
  divergence in altered clinical meaning. The expert algorithm maintained the clinical
  meaning of laboratory results better (affecting up to 4% of test results) than simple
  perturbation (affecting up to 26%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: With growing impetus
  for sharing clinical data for research, and in view of healthcare-related federal
  privacy regulation, methods to mitigate risks of re-identification are important.
  A practical, expert-derived perturbation algorithm that demonstrated potential utility
  was developed. Similar approaches might enable administrators to select data protection
  scheme parameters that meet their preferences in the trade-off between the protection
  of privacy and the retention of clinical meaning of shared data."
