abstract: 'BACKGROUND: High-alert medications are frequently responsible for adverse
  drug events and present significant hazards to inpatients, despite technical improvements
  in the way they are ordered, dispensed, and administered. METHODS: A real-time surveillance
  application was designed and implemented to enable pharmacy review of high-alert
  medication orders to complement existing computerized provider order entry and integrated
  clinical decision support systems in a tertiary care hospital. The surveillance
  tool integrated real-time data from multiple clinical systems and applied logical
  criteria to highlight potentially high-risk scenarios. Use of the surveillance system
  for adult inpatients was analyzed for warfarin, heparin and enoxaparin, and aminoglycoside
  antibiotics. RESULTS: Among 28,929 hospitalizations during the study period, patients
  eligible to appear on a dashboard included 2224 exposed to warfarin, 8383 to heparin
  or enoxaparin, and 893 to aminoglycosides. Clinical pharmacists reviewed the warfarin
  and aminoglycoside dashboards during 100% of the days in the study period-and the
  heparinlenoxaparin dashboard during 71% of the days. Displayed alert conditions
  ranged from common events, such as 55% of patients receiving aminoglycosides were
  missing a baseline creatinine, to rare events, such as 0.1% of patients exposed
  to heparin were given a bolus greater than 10,000 units. On the basis of interpharmacist
  communication and electronic medical record notes recorded within the dashboards,
  interventions to prevent further patient harm were frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Even in
  an environment with sophisticated computerized provider order entry and clinical
  decision support systems, real-time pharmacy surveillance of high-alert medications
  provides an important platform for intercepting medication errors and optimizing
  therapy.'
