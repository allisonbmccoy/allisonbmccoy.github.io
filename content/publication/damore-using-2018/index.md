abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Value-based payment for care requires the consistent, objective
  calculation of care quality. Previous initiatives to calculate ambulatory quality
  measures have relied on billing data or individual electronic health records (EHRs)
  to calculate and report performance. New methods for quality measure calculation
  promoted by federal regulations allow qualified clinical data registries to report
  quality outcomes based on data aggregated across facilities and EHRs using interoperability
  standards. OBJECTIVE: This research evaluates the use of clinical document interchange
  standards as the basis for quality measurement. METHODS: Using data on 1,100 patients
  from 11 ambulatory care facilities and 5 different EHRs, challenges to quality measurement
  are identified and addressed for 17 certified quality measures. RESULTS: Iterative
  solutions were identified for 14 measures that improved patient inclusion and measure
  calculation accuracy. Findings validate this approach to improving measure accuracy
  while maintaining measure certification. CONCLUSION: Organizations that report care
  quality should be aware of how identified issues affect quality measure selection
  and calculation. Quality measure authors should consider increasing real-world validation
  and the consistency of measure logic in respect to issues identified in this research.'
