abstract: 'To overcome limitations of previously developed scientific productivity
  ranking services, we created the Biomedical Informatics Researchers ranking website
  (rank.informatics-review.com). The website is composed of four key components that
  work together to create the automatically updating ranking website: 1) list of biomedical
  informatics researchers, 2) Google Scholar scraper, 3) display page, and 4) updater.
  The interactive website has facilitated identification of leaders in each of the
  key citation statistics categories (i.e., number of citations, h-index, and i10-index),
  and it has allowed other groups, such as tenure and promotions committees, to more
  effectively and efficiently evaluate researchers and interpret the various citation
  statistics reported by candidates. Creation of the biomedical informatics researcher
  ranking website highlights the vast differences in scholarly productivity among
  members of the biomedical informatics research community. Future efforts are underway
  to add new functionality to the website and to expand the work to identify top papers
  in biomedical informatics.'
