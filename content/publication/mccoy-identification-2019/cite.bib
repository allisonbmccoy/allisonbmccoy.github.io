 abstract = {To overcome limitations of previously developed scientific productivity ranking services, we created the Biomedical Informatics Researchers ranking website (rank.informatics-review.com). The website is composed of four key components that work together to create the automatically updating ranking website: 1) list of biomedical informatics researchers, 2) Google Scholar scraper, 3) display page, and 4) updater. The interactive website has facilitated identification of leaders in each of the key citation statistics categories (i.e., number of citations, h-index, and i10-index), and it has allowed other groups, such as tenure and promotions committees, to more effectively and efficiently evaluate researchers and interpret the various citation statistics reported by candidates. Creation of the biomedical informatics researcher ranking website highlights the vast differences in scholarly productivity among members of the biomedical informatics research community. Future efforts are underway to add new functionality to the website and to expand the work to identify top papers in biomedical informatics.},
