abstract: "BACKGROUND: Therapy for certain medical conditions occurs in a stepwise
  fashion, where one medication is recommended as initial therapy and other medications
  follow. Sequential pattern mining is a data mining technique used to identify patterns
  of ordered events. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sequential pattern mining is
  effective for identifying temporal relationships between medications and accurately
  predicting the next medication likely to be prescribed for a patient. DESIGN: We
  obtained claims data from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas for patients prescribed
  at least one diabetes medication between 2008 and 2011, and divided these into a
  training set (90% of patients) and test set (10% of patients). We applied the CSPADE
  algorithm to mine sequential patterns of diabetes medication prescriptions both
  at the drug class and generic drug level and ranked them by the support statistic.
  We then evaluated the accuracy of predictions made for which diabetes medication
  a patient was likely to be prescribed next. RESULTS: We identified 161,497 patients
  who had been prescribed at least one diabetes medication. We were able to mine stepwise
  patterns of pharmacological therapy that were consistent with guidelines. Within
  three attempts, we were able to predict the medication prescribed for 90.0% of patients
  when making predictions by drug class, and for 64.1% when making predictions at
  the generic drug level. These results were stable under 10-fold cross validation,
  ranging from 89.1%-90.5% at the drug class level and 63.5-64.9% at the generic drug
  level. Using 1 or 2 items in the patient's medication history led to more accurate
  predictions than not using any history, but using the entire history was sometimes
  worse. CONCLUSION: Sequential pattern mining is an effective technique to identify
  temporal relationships between medications and can be used to predict next steps
  in a patient's medication regimen. Accurate predictions can be made without using
  the patient's entire medication history."
