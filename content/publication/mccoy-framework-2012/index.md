abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Alerting systems, a type of clinical decision support, are increasingly
  prevalent in healthcare, yet few studies have concurrently measured the appropriateness
  of alerts with provider responses to alerts. Recent reports of suboptimal alert
  system design and implementation highlight the need for better evaluation to inform
  future designs. The authors present a comprehensive framework for evaluating the
  clinical appropriateness of synchronous, interruptive medication safety alerts.
  METHODS: Through literature review and iterative testing, metrics were developed
  that describe successes, justifiable overrides, provider non-adherence, and unintended
  adverse consequences of clinical decision support alerts. The framework was validated
  by applying it to a medication alerting system for patients with acute kidney injury
  (AKI). RESULTS: Through expert review, the framework assesses each alert episode
  for appropriateness of the alert display and the necessity and urgency of a clinical
  response. Primary outcomes of the framework include the false positive alert rate,
  alert override rate, provider non-adherence rate, and rate of provider response
  appropriateness. Application of the framework to evaluate an existing AKI medication
  alerting system provided a more complete understanding of the process outcomes measured
  in the AKI medication alerting system. The authors confirmed that previous alerts
  and provider responses were most often appropriate. CONCLUSION: The new evaluation
  model offers a potentially effective method for assessing the clinical appropriateness
  of synchronous interruptive medication alerts prior to evaluating patient outcomes
  in a comparative trial. More work can determine the generalizability of the framework
  for use in other settings and other alert types.'
