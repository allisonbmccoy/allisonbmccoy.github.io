abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To assess problem list completeness using an objective measure
  across a range of sites, and to identify success factors for problem list completeness.
  METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data
  and interviews at ten healthcare organizations within the United States, United
  Kingdom, and Argentina who use a variety of electronic health record systems: four
  self-developed and six commercial. At each site, we assessed the proportion of patients
  who have diabetes recorded on their problem list out of all patients with a hemoglobin
  A1c elevationtextgreater=7.0%, which is diagnostic of diabetes. We then conducted
  interviews with informatics leaders at the four highest performing sites to determine
  factors associated with success. Finally, we surveyed all the sites about common
  practices implemented at the top performing sites to determine whether there was
  an association between problem list management practices and problem list completeness.
  RESULTS: Problem list completeness across the ten sites ranged from 60.2% to 99.4%,
  with a mean of 78.2%. Financial incentives, problem-oriented charting, gap reporting,
  shared responsibility, links to billing codes, and organizational culture were identified
  as success factors at the four hospitals with problem list completeness at or near
  90.0%. DISCUSSION: Incomplete problem lists represent a global data integrity problem
  that could compromise quality of care and put patients at risk. There was a wide
  range of problem list completeness across the healthcare facilities. Nevertheless,
  some facilities have achieved high levels of problem list completeness, and it is
  important to better understand the factors that contribute to success to improve
  patient safety. CONCLUSION: Problem list completeness varies substantially across
  healthcare facilities. In our review of EHR systems at ten healthcare facilities,
  we identified six success factors which may be useful for healthcare organizations
  seeking to improve the quality of their problem list documentation: financial incentives,
  problem oriented charting, gap reporting, shared responsibility, links to billing
  codes, and organizational culture.'
