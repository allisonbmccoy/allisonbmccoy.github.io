abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Complex interventions with multiple components and behavior
  change strategies are increasingly implemented as a form of clinical decision support
  (CDS) using native electronic health record functionality. Objectives of this study
  were, therefore, to (1) identify the proportion of randomized controlled trials
  with CDS interventions that were complex, (2) describe common gaps in the reporting
  of complexity in CDS research, and (3) determine the impact of increased complexity
  on CDS effectiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess CDS complexity and identify
  reporting gaps for characterizing CDS interventions, we used the Preferred Reporting
  Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting tool for complex interventions.
  We evaluated the effect of increased complexity using random-effects meta-analysis.
  RESULTS: Most included studies evaluated a complex CDS intervention (76%). No studies
  described use of analytical frameworks or causal pathways. Two studies discussed
  use of theory but only one fully described the rationale and put it in context of
  a behavior change. A small but positive effect (standardized mean difference, 0.147;
  95% CI, 0.039-0.255; P &lt; .01) in favor of increasing intervention complexity
  was observed. DISCUSSION: While most CDS studies should classify interventions as
  complex, opportunities persist for documenting and providing resources in a manner
  that would enable CDS interventions to be replicated and adapted. Unless reporting
  of the design, implementation, and evaluation of CDS interventions improves, only
  slight benefits can be expected. CONCLUSION: Conceptualizing CDS as complex interventions
  may help convey the careful attention that is needed to ensure these interventions
  are contextually and theoretically informed.'
