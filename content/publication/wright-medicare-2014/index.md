abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To measure performance by eligible health care providers on
  CMS's meaningful use measures. DATA SOURCE: Medicare Electronic Health Record Incentive
  Program Eligible Professionals Public Use File (PUF), which contains data on meaningful
  use attestations by 237,267 eligible providers through May 31, 2013. STUDY DESIGN:
  Cross-sectional analysis of the 15 core and 10 menu measures pertaining to use of
  EHR functions reported in the PUF. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Providers in the dataset
  performed strongly on all core measures, with the most frequent response for each
  of the 15 measures being 90-100 percent compliance, even when the threshold for
  a particular measure was lower (e.g., 30 percent). PCPs had higher scores than specialists
  for computerized order entry, maintaining an active medication list, and documenting
  vital signs, while specialists had higher scores for maintaining a problem list,
  recording patient demographics and smoking status, and for providing patients with
  an after-visit summary. In fact, 90.2 percent of eligible providers claimed at least
  one exclusion, and half claimed two or more. CONCLUSIONS: Providers are successfully
  attesting to CMS's requirements, and often exceeding the thresholds required by
  CMS; however, some troubling patterns in exclusions are present. CMS should raise
  program requirements in future years."
