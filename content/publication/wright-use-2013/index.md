abstract: "BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) users must regularly review
  large amounts of data in order to make informed clinical decisions, and such review
  is time-consuming and often overwhelming. Technologies like automated summarization
  tools, EHR search engines and natural language processing have been shown to help
  clinicians manage this information. OBJECTIVE: To develop a support vector machine
  (SVM)-based system for identifying EHR progress notes pertaining to diabetes, and
  to validate it at two institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved 2000 EHR
  progress notes from patients with diabetes at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (1000
  for training and 1000 for testing) and another 1000 notes from the University of
  Texas Physicians (for validation). We manually annotated all notes and trained a
  SVM using a bag of words approach. We then used the SVM on the testing and validation
  sets and evaluated its performance with the area under the curve (AUC) and F statistics.
  RESULTS: The model accurately identified diabetes-related notes in both the Brigham
  and Women's Hospital testing set (AUC=0.956, F=0.934) and the external University
  of Texas Faculty Physicians validation set (AUC=0.947, F=0.935). DISCUSSION: Overall,
  the model we developed was quite accurate. Furthermore, it generalized, without
  loss of accuracy, to another institution with a different EHR and a distinct patient
  and provider population. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use a SVM-based classifier
  to identify EHR progress notes pertaining to diabetes, and the model generalizes
  well."
