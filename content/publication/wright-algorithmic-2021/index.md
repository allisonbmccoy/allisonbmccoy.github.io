abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Clinical decision support (CDS) can contribute to quality and
  safety. Prior work has shown that errors in CDS systems are common and can lead
  to unintended consequences. Many CDS systems use Boolean logic, which can be difficult
  for CDS analysts to specify accurately. We set out to determine the prevalence of
  certain types of Boolean logic errors in CDS statements. METHODS: Nine health care
  organizations extracted Boolean logic statements from their Epic electronic health
  record (EHR). We developed an open-source software tool, which implemented the Espresso
  logic minimization algorithm, to identify three classes of logic errors. RESULTS:
  Participating organizations submitted 260,698 logic statements, of which 44,890
  were minimized by Espresso. We found errors in 209 of them. Every participating
  organization had at least two errors, and all organizations reported that they would
  act on the feedback. DISCUSSION: An automated algorithm can readily detect specific
  categories of Boolean CDS logic errors. These errors represent a minority of CDS
  errors, but very likely require correction to avoid patient safety issues. This
  process found only a few errors at each site, but the problem appears to be widespread,
  affecting all participating organizations. CONCLUSION: Both CDS implementers and
  EHR vendors should consider implementing similar algorithms as part of the CDS authoring
  process to reduce the number of errors in their CDS interventions.'
