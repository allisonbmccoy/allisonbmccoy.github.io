abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To quantify the percentage of records with matching identifiers
  as an indicator for duplicate or potentially duplicate patient records in electronic
  health records in five different healthcare organisations, describe the patient
  safety issues that may arise, and present solutions for managing duplicate records
  or records with matching identifiers. METHODS: For each institution, we retrieved
  deidentified counts of records with an exact match of patient first and last names
  and dates of birth and determined the number of patient records existing for the
  top 250 most frequently occurring first and last name pairs. We also identified
  methods for managing duplicate records or records with matching identifiers, reporting
  the adoption rate of each across institutions. RESULTS: The occurrence of matching
  first and last name in two or more individuals ranged from 16.49% to 40.66% of records;
  inclusion of date of birth reduced the rates to range from 0.16% to 15.47%. The
  number of records existing for the most frequently occurring name at each site ranged
  from 41 to 2552. Institutions varied widely in the methods they implemented for
  preventing, detecting and removing duplicate records, and mitigating resulting errors.
  CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of records having matching patient identifiers is high
  in several organisations, indicating that the rate of duplicate records or records
  may also be high. Further efforts are necessary to improve management of duplicate
  records or records with matching identifiers and minimise the risk for patient harm.'
