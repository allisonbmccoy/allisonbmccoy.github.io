abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: This literature review summarizes relevant studies from the
  last three years (2020-2022) related to clinical decision support (CDS) and CDS
  impact on health disparities and the digital divide. This survey identifies current
  trends and synthesizes evidence-based recommendations and considerations for future
  development and implementation of CDS tools. METHODS: We conducted a search in PubMed
  for literature published between 2020 and 2022. Our search strategy was constructed
  as a combination of the MEDLINE®/PubMed® Health Disparities and Minority Health
  Search Strategy and relevant CDS MeSH terms and phrases. We then extracted relevant
  data from the studies, including priority population when applicable, domain of
  influence on the disparity being addressed, and the type of CDS being used. We also
  made note of when a study discussed the digital divide in some capacity and organized
  the comments into general themes through group discussion. RESULTS: Our search yielded
  520 studies, with 45 included at the conclusion of screening. The most frequent
  CDS type in this review was point-of-care alerts/reminders (33.3%). Health Care
  System was the most frequent domain of influence (71.1%), and Blacks/African Americans
  were the most frequently included priority population (42.2%). Throughout the literature,
  we found four general themes related to the technology divide: inaccessibility of
  technology, access to care, trust of technology, and technology literacy.This survey
  revealed the diversity of CDS being used to address health disparities and several
  barriers which may make CDS less effective or potentially harmful to certain populations.
  Regular examinations of literature that feature CDS and address health disparities
  can help to reveal new strategies and patterns for improving healthcare.'
