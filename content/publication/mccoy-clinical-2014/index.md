abstract: "BACKGROUND: Many healthcare providers are adopting clinical decision support
  (CDS) systems to improve patient safety and meet meaningful use requirements. Computerized
  alerts that prompt clinicians about drug-allergy, drug-drug, and drug-disease warnings
  or provide dosing guidance are most commonly implemented. Alert overrides, which
  occur when clinicians do not follow the guidance presented by the alert, can hinder
  improved patient outcomes. METHODS: We present a review of CDS alerts and describe
  a proposal to develop novel methods for evaluating and improving CDS alerts that
  builds upon traditional informatics approaches. Our proposal incorporates previously
  described models for predicting alert overrides that utilize retrospective chart
  review to determine which alerts are clinically relevant and which overrides are
  justifiable. RESULTS: Despite increasing implementations of CDS alerts, detailed
  evaluations rarely occur because of the extensive labor involved in manual chart
  reviews to determine alert and response appropriateness. Further, most studies have
  solely evaluated alert overrides that are appropriate or justifiable. Our proposal
  expands the use of web-based monitoring tools with an interactive dashboard for
  evaluating CDS alert and response appropriateness that incorporates the predictive
  models. The dashboard provides 2 views, an alert detail view and a patient detail
  view, to provide a full history of alerts and help put the patient's events in context.
  CONCLUSION: The proposed research introduces several innovations to address the
  challenges and gaps in alert evaluations. This research can transform alert evaluation
  processes across healthcare settings, leading to improved CDS, reduced alert fatigue,
  and increased patient safety."
