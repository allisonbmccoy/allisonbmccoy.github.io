abstract: Interruptive clinical decision support systems, both within and outside
  of electronic health records, are a resource that should be used sparingly and monitored
  closely. Excessive use of interruptive alerting can quickly lead to alert fatigue
  and decreased effectiveness and ignoring of alerts. In this review, we discuss the
  evidence for effective alert stewardship as well as practices and methods we have
  found useful to assess interruptive alert burden, reduce excessive firings, optimize
  alert effectiveness, and establish quality governance at our institutions. We also
  discuss the importance of a holistic view of the alerting ecosystem beyond the electronic
  health record.
