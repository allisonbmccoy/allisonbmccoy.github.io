abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and associated with
  adverse clinical outcomes. Most care for early CKD is provided in primary care,
  including hypertension (HTN) management. Computerized clinical decision support
  (CDS) can improve the quality of care for CKD but can also cause alert fatigue for
  primary care physicians (PCPs). Computable phenotypes (CPs) are algorithms to identify
  disease populations using, for example, specific laboratory data criteria. OBJECTIVES:
  Our objective was to determine the feasibility of implementation of CDS alerts by
  developing CPs and estimating potential alert burden. METHODS: We utilized clinical
  guidelines to develop a set of five CPs for patients with stage 3 to 4 CKD, uncontrolled
  HTN, and indications for initiation or titration of guideline-recommended antihypertensive
  agents. We then conducted an iterative data analytic process consisting of database
  queries, data validation, and subject matter expert discussion, to make iterative
  changes to the CPs. We estimated the potential alert burden to make final decisions
  about the scope of the CDS alerts. Specifically, the number of times that each alert
  could fire was limited to once per patient. RESULTS: In our primary care network,
  there were 239,339 encounters for 105,992 primary care patients between April 1,
  2018 and April 1, 2019. Of these patients, 9,081 (8.6%) had stage 3 and 4 CKD. Almost
  half of the CKD patients, 4,191 patients, also had uncontrolled HTN. The majority
  of CKD patients were female, elderly, white, and English-speaking. We estimated
  that 5,369 alerts would fire if alerts were triggered multiple times per patient,
  with a mean number of alerts shown to each PCP ranging from 0.07-to 0.17 alerts
  per week. CONCLUSION: Development of CPs and estimation of alert burden allows researchers
  to iteratively fine-tune CDS prior to implementation. This method of assessment
  can help organizations balance the tradeoff between standardization of care and
  alert fatigue.'
