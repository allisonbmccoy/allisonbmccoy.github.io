abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The study sought to determine availability and use of structured
  override reasons for drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts in electronic health records.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data on DDI alerts and override reasons from
  10 clinical sites across the United States using a variety of electronic health
  records. We used a multistage iterative card sort method to categorize the override
  reasons from all sites and identified best practices. RESULTS: Our methodology established
  177 unique override reasons across the 10 sites. The number of coded override reasons
  at each site ranged from 3 to 100. Many sites offered override reasons not relevant
  to DDIs. Twelve categories of override reasons were identified. Three categories
  accounted for 78% of all overrides: \"will monitor or take precautions,\" \"not
  clinically significant,\" and \"benefit outweighs risk.\" DISCUSSION: We found wide
  variability in override reasons between sites and many opportunities to improve
  alerts. Some override reasons were irrelevant to DDIs. Many override reasons attested
  to a future action (eg, decreasing a dose or ordering monitoring tests), which requires
  an additional step after the alert is overridden, unless the alert is made actionable.
  Some override reasons deferred to another party, although override reasons often
  are not visible to other users. Many override reasons stated that the alert was
  inaccurate, suggesting that specificity of alerts could be improved. CONCLUSIONS:
  Organizations should improve the options available to providers who choose to override
  DDI alerts. DDI alerting systems should be actionable and alerts should be tailored
  to the patient and drug pairs.'
