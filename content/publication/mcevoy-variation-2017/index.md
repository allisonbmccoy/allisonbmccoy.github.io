abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The United States Office of the National Coordinator for Health
  Information Technology sponsored the development of a \"high-priority\" list of
  drug-drug interactions (DDIs) to be used for clinical decision support. We assessed
  current adoption of this list and current alerting practice for these DDIs with
  regard to alert implementation (presence or absence of an alert) and display (alert
  appearance as interruptive or passive). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted evaluations
  of electronic health records (EHRs) at a convenience sample of health care organizations
  across the United States using a standardized testing protocol with simulated orders.
  RESULTS: Evaluations of 19 systems were conducted at 13 sites using 14 different
  EHRs. Across systems, 69% of the high-priority DDI pairs produced alerts. Implementation
  and display of the DDI alerts tested varied between systems, even when the same
  EHR vendor was used. Across the drug pairs evaluated, implementation and display
  of DDI alerts differed, ranging from 27% (4/15) to 93% (14/15) implementation. DISCUSSION:
  Currently, there is no standard of care covering which DDI alerts to implement or
  how to display them to providers. Opportunities to improve DDI alerting include
  using differential displays based on DDI severity, establishing improved lists of
  clinically significant DDIs, and thoroughly reviewing organizational implementation
  decisions regarding DDIs. CONCLUSION: DDI alerting is clinically important but not
  standardized. There is significant room for improvement and standardization around
  evidence-based DDIs.'
