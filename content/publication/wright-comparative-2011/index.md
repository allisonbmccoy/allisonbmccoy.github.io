abstract: The problem list is a critical component of the electronic medical record,
  with implications for clinical care, provider communication, clinical decision support,
  quality measurement and research. However, many of its benefits depend on the use
  of coded terminologies. Two standard terminologies (ICD-9 and SNOMED-CT) are available
  for problem documentation, and two SNOMED-CT subsets (VA/KP and CORE) are available
  for SNOMED-CT users. We set out to examine these subsets, characterize their overlap
  and measure their coverage. We applied the subsets to a random sample of 100,000
  records from Brigham and Women's Hospital to determine the proportion of problems
  covered. Though CORE is smaller (5,814 terms vs. 17,761 terms for VA/KP), 94.8%
  of coded problem entries from BWH were in the CORE subset, while only 84.0% of entries
  had matches in VA/KP (ptextless0.001). Though both subsets had reasonable coverage,
  CORE was superior in our sample, and had fewer clinically significant gaps.
