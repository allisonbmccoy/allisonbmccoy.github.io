abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: We identified the methods used and determined the roles of electronic
  health records (EHRs) in detecting and assessing adverse drug events (ADEs) in the
  ambulatory setting. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review by searching
  PubMed and Google Scholar for studies on ADEs detected in the ambulatory setting
  involving any EHR use published before June 2017. We extracted study characteristics
  from included studies related to ADE detection methods for analysis. RESULTS: We
  identified 30 studies that evaluated ADEs in an ambulatory setting with an EHR.
  In 27 studies, EHRs were used only as the data source for ADE identification. In
  two studies, the EHR was used as both a data source and to deliver decision support
  to providers during order entry. In one study, the EHR was a source of data and
  generated patient safety reports that researchers used in the process of identifying
  ADEs. Methods of identification included manual chart review by trained nurses,
  pharmacists, and/or physicians; prescription review; computer monitors; electronic
  triggers; International Classification of Diseases codes; natural language processing
  of clinical notes; and patient phone calls and surveys. Seven studies provided examples
  of search phrases, laboratory values, and rules used to identify ADEs. CONCLUSION:
  The majority of studies examined used EHRs as sources of data for ADE detection.
  This retrospective approach is appropriate to measure incidence rates of ADEs but
  not adequate to detect preventable ADEs before patient harm occurs. New methods
  involving computer monitors and electronic triggers will enable researchers to catch
  preventable ADEs and take corrective action.'
