abstract: In the past 2 decades, the United States has seen widespread adoption of
  electronic health records (EHRs) and a transition from mostly locally developed
  EHRs to commercial systems. However, most research on quality improvement and safety
  interventions in EHRs is still conducted at a single site, in a single EHR. Although
  single-site studies are important early in the innovation lifecycle, multisite studies
  of EHR interventions are critical for generalizability. Because EHR software, configuration,
  and local context differ considerably across health care organizations, it can be
  difficult to implement a single, standardized intervention across multiple sites
  in a study. This article outlines key strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities
  for standardization of EHR interventions in multisite studies and describes flexible
  trial designs suitable for studying complex interventions, including EHR interventions.
  It also outlines key considerations for reporting on flexible trials of EHR interventions,
  including sharing details of the process for designing interventions and their content,
  details of outcomes being studied and approaches for pooling, and the importance
  of sharing code and configuration whenever possible.
