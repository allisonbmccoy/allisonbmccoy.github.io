abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To quantify initial tidal volume (VT) during neonatal volume-targeted
  ventilation (VTV) and to characterize the agreement of initial VT with the limited-evidence
  available. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a multi-center retrospective observational
  cohort study in two Neonatal Intensive Care Units evaluating 313 infants who received
  VTV as the initial ventilation modality prior to postnatal day 14. We generated
  descriptive statistics and performed multivariable logistic regression analysis
  to determine factors associated with initial VT use that agreed with available literature.
  RESULTS: 154 (49%) infants received an initial VT of 5.0 mL/kg (median 5.0 mL/kg,
  IQR 5.0-5.1). 45 (14%) infants received an initial VT that was congruent with available
  literature. A birth weight of 700 -textless1250 g was significantly associated with
  an initial VT in agreement with VT literature (aOR 9.4, 95% CI 1.7-50.4). CONCLUSIONS:
  Most infants receive an initial VT of 5.0 mL/kg.'
