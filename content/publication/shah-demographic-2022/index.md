abstract: 'BACKGROUND: This study evaluated synchronous audiovisual telehealth and
  audio-only visits for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to determine
  frequency of successful telehealth visits and determine what factors increase the
  likelihood of completion. METHODS: Data were collected from March to July 2020 in
  a tertiary care adult IBD clinic that was transitioned to a fully telehealth model.
  A protocol for telehealth was implemented. A retrospective analysis was performed
  using electronic medical record (EMR) data. All patients were scheduled for video
  telehealth. If this failed, providers attempted to conduct the visit as audio only.
  RESULTS: Between March and July 2020, 2571 telehealth visits were scheduled for
  adult patients with IBD. Of these, 2498 (99%) were successfully completed by video
  or phone. Sixty percent were female, and the median age was 41 years. Eighty six
  percent of the population was white, 8% black, 2% other, and 4% were missing. Seventy-five
  percent had commercial insurance, 15% had Medicare, 5% had Medicaid, and 5% had
  other insurance. No significant factors were found for an attempted but completely
  failed visit. Using a multivariate logistic regression model, increasing age (odds
  ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.55-2.08; P textless 0.05), noncommercial insurance status
  (odds ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.61-2.21; P textless 0.05), and black race (odds ratio,
  2.07; 95% CI, 1.38-3.08; P textless 0.05) increased the likelihood of a video encounter
  failure. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high success rate for telehealth within an IBD
  population with defined clinic protocols. Certain patient characteristics such as
  age, race, and health insurance type increase the risk of failure of a video visit.'
