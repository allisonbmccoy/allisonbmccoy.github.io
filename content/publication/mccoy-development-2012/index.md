abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: We describe a novel, crowdsourcing method for generating a knowledge
  base of problem-medication pairs that takes advantage of manually asserted links
  between medications and problems. METHODS: Through iterative review, we developed
  metrics to estimate the appropriateness of manually entered problem-medication links
  for inclusion in a knowledge base that can be used to infer previously unasserted
  links between problems and medications. RESULTS: Clinicians manually linked 231,223
  medications (55.30% of prescribed medications) to problems within the electronic
  health record, generating 41,203 distinct problem-medication pairs, although not
  all were accurate. We developed methods to evaluate the accuracy of the pairs, and
  after limiting the pairs to those meeting an estimated 95% appropriateness threshold,
  11,166 pairs remained. The pairs in the knowledge base accounted for 183,127 total
  links asserted (76.47% of all links). Retrospective application of the knowledge
  base linked 68,316 medications not previously linked by a clinician to an indicated
  problem (36.53% of unlinked medications). Expert review of the combined knowledge
  base, including inferred and manually linked problem-medication pairs, found a sensitivity
  of 65.8% and a specificity of 97.9%. CONCLUSION: Crowdsourcing is an effective,
  inexpensive method for generating a knowledge base of problem-medication pairs that
  is automatically mapped to local terminologies, up-to-date, and reflective of local
  prescribing practices and trends.'
