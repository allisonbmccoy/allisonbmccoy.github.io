abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: We describe the Clickbusters initiative implemented at Vanderbilt
  University Medical Center (VUMC), which was designed to improve safety and quality
  and reduce burnout through the optimization of clinical decision support (CDS) alerts.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a 10-step Clickbusting process and implemented
  a program that included a curriculum, CDS alert inventory, oversight process, and
  gamification. We carried out two 3-month rounds of the Clickbusters program at VUMC.
  We completed descriptive analyses of the changes made to alerts during the process,
  and of alert firing rates before and after the program. RESULTS: Prior to Clickbusters,
  VUMC had 419 CDS alerts in production, with 488 425 firings (42 982 interruptive)
  each week. After 2 rounds, the Clickbusters program resulted in detailed, comprehensive
  reviews of 84 CDS alerts and reduced the number of weekly alert firings by more
  than 70 000 (15.43%). In addition to the direct improvements in CDS, the initiative
  also increased user engagement and involvement in CDS. CONCLUSIONS: At VUMC, the
  Clickbusters program was successful in optimizing CDS alerts by reducing alert firings
  and resulting clicks. The program also involved more users in the process of evaluating
  and improving CDS and helped build a culture of continuous evaluation and improvement
  of clinical content in the electronic health record.'
