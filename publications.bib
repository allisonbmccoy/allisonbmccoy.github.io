	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frequently, prescribers fail to account for changing kidney function when prescribing medications. We evaluated the use of a computerized provider order entry intervention to improve medication management during acute kidney injury.
STUDY DESIGN: Quality improvement report with time series analyses.
SETTING \& PARTICIPANTS: 1,598 adult inpatients with a minimum 0.5-mg/dL increase in serum creatinine level over 48 hours after an order for at least one of 122 nephrotoxic or renally cleared medications.
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN: Passive noninteractive warnings about increasing serum creatinine level appeared within the computerized provider order entry interface and on printed rounding reports. For contraindicated or high-toxicity medications that should be avoided or adjusted, an interruptive alert within the system asked providers to modify or discontinue the targeted orders, mark the current dosing as correct and to remain unchanged, or defer the alert to reappear in the next session.
OUTCOMES \& MEASUREMENTS: Intervention effect on drug modification or discontinuation, time to modification or discontinuation, and provider interactions with alerts.
RESULTS: The modification or discontinuation rate per 100 events for medications included in the interruptive alert within 24 hours of increasing creatinine level improved from 35.2 preintervention to 52.6 postintervention (P {\textless} 0.001); orders were modified or discontinued more quickly (P {\textless} 0.001). During the postintervention period, providers initially deferred 78.1\% of interruptive alerts, although 54\% of these eventually were modified or discontinued before patient death, discharge, or transfer. The response to passive alerts about medications requiring review did not significantly change compared with baseline.
LIMITATIONS: Single tertiary-care academic medical center; provider actions were not independently adjudicated for appropriateness.
CONCLUSIONS: A computerized provider order entry-based alerting system to support medication management after acute kidney injury significantly increased the rate and timeliness of modification or discontinuation of targeted medications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective teaching of evidence-based medicine (EBM) to medical students is important for lifelong self-directed learning.
AIMS: We implemented a brief workshop designed to teach literature searching skills to third-year medical students. We assessed its impact on students' utilization of EBM resources during their clinical rotation and the quality of EBM integration in inpatient notes.
METHODS: We developed a physician-led, hands-on workshop to introduce EBM resources to all internal medicine clerks. Pre- and post-workshop measures included student's attitudes to EBM, citations of EBM resources in their clinical notes, and quality of the EBM component of the discussion in the note. Computer log analysis recorded students' online search attempts.
RESULTS: After the workshop, students reported improved comfort using EBM and increased utilization of EBM resources. EBM integration into the discussion component of the notes also showed significant improvement. Computer log analysis of students' searches demonstrated increased utilization of EBM resources following the workshop.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe the successful implementation of a workshop designed to teach third-year medical students how to perform an efficient EBM literature search. We demonstrated improvements in students' confidence regarding EBM, increased utilization of EBM resources, and improved integration of EBM into inpatient notes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-alert medications are frequently responsible for adverse drug events and present significant hazards to inpatients, despite technical improvements in the way they are ordered, dispensed, and administered.
METHODS: A real-time surveillance application was designed and implemented to enable pharmacy review of high-alert medication orders to complement existing computerized provider order entry and integrated clinical decision support systems in a tertiary care hospital. The surveillance tool integrated real-time data from multiple clinical systems and applied logical criteria to highlight potentially high-risk scenarios. Use of the surveillance system for adult inpatients was analyzed for warfarin, heparin and enoxaparin, and aminoglycoside antibiotics.
RESULTS: Among 28,929 hospitalizations during the study period, patients eligible to appear on a dashboard included 2224 exposed to warfarin, 8383 to heparin or enoxaparin, and 893 to aminoglycosides. Clinical pharmacists reviewed the warfarin and aminoglycoside dashboards during 100\% of the days in the study period-and the heparinlenoxaparin dashboard during 71\% of the days. Displayed alert conditions ranged from common events, such as 55\% of patients receiving aminoglycosides were missing a baseline creatinine, to rare events, such as 0.1\% of patients exposed to heparin were given a bolus greater than 10,000 units. On the basis of interpharmacist communication and electronic medical record notes recorded within the dashboards, interventions to prevent further patient harm were frequent.
CONCLUSIONS: Even in an environment with sophisticated computerized provider order entry and clinical decision support systems, real-time pharmacy surveillance of high-alert medications provides an important platform for intercepting medication errors and optimizing therapy.},

The authors sought to determine whether pharmacy surveillance of AKI patients could detect and prevent medication errors that are not corrected by automated interventions. METHODS: The authors conducted a randomized clinical trial among 396 patients admitted to an academic, tertiary care hospital between June 1, 2010 and August 31, 2010 with an acute 0.5 mg/dl change in serum creatinine over 48 hours and a nephrotoxic or renally cleared medication order. Patients randomly assigned to the intervention group received surveillance from a clinical pharmacist using a web-based surveillance tool to monitor drug prescribing and kidney function trends. CDS alerting and standard pharmacy services were active in both study arms. Outcome measures included blinded adjudication of potential adverse drug events (pADEs), adverse drug events (ADEs) and time to provider modification or discontinuation of targeted nephrotoxic or renally cleared medications. RESULTS: Potential ADEs or ADEs occurred for 104 (8.0\%) of control and 99 (7.1\%) of intervention patient-medication pairs (p=0.4). Additionally, the time to provider modification or discontinuation of targeted nephrotoxic or renally cleared medications did not differ between control and intervention patients (33.4 hrs vs. 30.3 hrs, p=0.3).

Overall, 642 BCMA alerts were analyzed with a 21.3\% acceptance rate. In subgroup analysis, we found that the BCMA acceptance rate was 6.9\% for patients aged less than one year, and 85.6\% for patients aged greater than one year. The major contributing factor to the low overall acceptance rate was the high frequency of alerts in patients less than 1 year of age. Modifications to rules logic may be necessary for this specific population. While BCMA alerts can beneficial, they should be carefully implemented with periodic post-implementation analysis and refinement.},

There is a paucity of research on electronic clinical summarization, including the capabilities of currently available EHR systems. METHODS: We compared different aspects of general clinical summary screens used in twelve different EHR systems using a previously described conceptual model: AORTIS (Aggregation, Organization, Reduction, Interpretation and Synthesis). RESULTS: We found a wide variation in the EHRs' summarization capabilities: all systems were capable of simple aggregation and organization of limited clinical content, but only one demonstrated an ability to synthesize information from the data. CONCLUSION: Improvement of the clinical summary screen functionality for currently available EHRs is necessary. Further research should identify strategies and methods for creating easy to use, well-designed clinical summary screens that aggregate, organize and reduce all pertinent patient information as well as provide clinical interpretations and synthesis as required.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Alerting systems, a type of clinical decision support, are increasingly prevalent in healthcare, yet few studies have concurrently measured the appropriateness of alerts with provider responses to alerts. Recent reports of suboptimal alert system design and implementation highlight the need for better evaluation to inform future designs. The authors present a comprehensive framework for evaluating the clinical appropriateness of synchronous, interruptive medication safety alerts.
METHODS: Through literature review and iterative testing, metrics were developed that describe successes, justifiable overrides, provider non-adherence, and unintended adverse consequences of clinical decision support alerts. The framework was validated by applying it to a medication alerting system for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).
RESULTS: Through expert review, the framework assesses each alert episode for appropriateness of the alert display and the necessity and urgency of a clinical response. Primary outcomes of the framework include the false positive alert rate, alert override rate, provider non-adherence rate, and rate of provider response appropriateness. Application of the framework to evaluate an existing AKI medication alerting system provided a more complete understanding of the process outcomes measured in the AKI medication alerting system. The authors confirmed that previous alerts and provider responses were most often appropriate.
CONCLUSION: The new evaluation model offers a potentially effective method for assessing the clinical appropriateness of synchronous interruptive medication alerts prior to evaluating patient outcomes in a comparative trial. More work can determine the generalizability of the framework for use in other settings and other alert types.},

METHODS: Through iterative review, we developed metrics to estimate the appropriateness of manually entered problem-medication links for inclusion in a knowledge base that can be used to infer previously unasserted links between problems and medications.
RESULTS: Clinicians manually linked 231,223 medications (55.30\% of prescribed medications) to problems within the electronic health record, generating 41,203 distinct problem-medication pairs, although not all were accurate. We developed methods to evaluate the accuracy of the pairs, and after limiting the pairs to those meeting an estimated 95\% appropriateness threshold, 11,166 pairs remained. The pairs in the knowledge base accounted for 183,127 total links asserted (76.47\% of all links). Retrospective application of the knowledge base linked 68,316 medications not previously linked by a clinician to an indicated problem (36.53\% of unlinked medications). Expert review of the combined knowledge base, including inferred and manually linked problem-medication pairs, found a sensitivity of 65.8\% and a specificity of 97.9\%.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To try to lower patient re-identification risks for biomedical research databases containing laboratory test results while also minimizing changes in clinical data interpretation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our threat model, an attacker obtains 5-7 laboratory results from one patient and uses them as a search key to discover the corresponding record in a de-identified biomedical research database. To test our models, the existing Vanderbilt TIME database of 8.5 million Safe Harbor de-identified laboratory results from 61 280 patients was used. The uniqueness of unaltered laboratory results in the dataset was examined, and then two data perturbation models were applied-simple random offsets and an expert-derived clinical meaning-preserving model. A rank-based re-identification algorithm to mimic an attack was used. The re-identification risk and the retention of clinical meaning for each model's perturbed laboratory results were assessed.
RESULTS: Differences in re-identification rates between the algorithms were small despite substantial divergence in altered clinical meaning. The expert algorithm maintained the clinical meaning of laboratory results better (affecting up to 4\% of test results) than simple perturbation (affecting up to 26\%).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: With growing impetus for sharing clinical data for research, and in view of healthcare-related federal privacy regulation, methods to mitigate risks of re-identification are important. A practical, expert-derived perturbation algorithm that demonstrated potential utility was developed. Similar approaches might enable administrators to select data protection scheme parameters that meet their preferences in the trade-off between the protection of privacy and the retention of clinical meaning of shared data.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the percentage of records with matching identifiers as an indicator for duplicate or potentially duplicate patient records in electronic health records in five different healthcare organisations, describe the patient safety issues that may arise, and present solutions for managing duplicate records or records with matching identifiers.
METHODS: For each institution, we retrieved deidentified counts of records with an exact match of patient first and last names and dates of birth and determined the number of patient records existing for the top 250 most frequently occurring first and last name pairs. We also identified methods for managing duplicate records or records with matching identifiers, reporting the adoption rate of each across institutions.
RESULTS: The occurrence of matching first and last name in two or more individuals ranged from 16.49\% to 40.66\% of records; inclusion of date of birth reduced the rates to range from 0.16\% to 15.47\%. The number of records existing for the most frequently occurring name at each site ranged from 41 to 2552. Institutions varied widely in the methods they implemented for preventing, detecting and removing duplicate records, and mitigating resulting errors.
CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of records having matching patient identifiers is high in several organisations, indicating that the rate of duplicate records or records may also be high. Further efforts are necessary to improve management of duplicate records or records with matching identifiers and minimise the risk for patient harm.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) program seeks to conquer well-understood challenges in medical informatics through breakthrough research. Two SHARP centers have found alignment in their methodological needs: (1) members of the National Center for Cognitive Informatics and Decision-making (NCCD) have developed knowledge bases to support problem-oriented summarizations of patient data, and (2) Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technologies (SMART), which is a platform for reusable medical apps that can run on participating platforms connected to various electronic health records (EHR). Combining the work of these two centers will ensure wide dissemination of new methods for synthesized views of patient data. Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is an NIH-funded clinical research data repository platform in use at over 100 sites worldwide. By also working with a co-occurring initiative to SMART-enabling i2b2, we can confidently write one app that can be used extremely broadly.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to facilitate development of intuitive, problem-oriented views of the patient record using NCCD knowledge bases that would run in any EHR. To do this, we developed a collaboration between the two SHARPs and an NIH center, i2b2.
METHODS: First, we implemented collaborative tools to connect researchers at three institutions. Next, we developed a patient summarization app using the SMART platform and a previously validated NCCD problem-medication linkage knowledge base derived from the National Drug File-Reference Terminology (NDF-RT). Finally, to SMART-enable i2b2, we implemented two new Web service "cells" that expose the SMART application programming interface (API), and we made changes to the Web interface of i2b2 to host a "carousel" of SMART apps.
RESULTS: We deployed our SMART-based, NDF-RT-derived patient summarization app in this SMART-i2b2 container. It displays a problem-oriented view of medications and presents a line-graph display of laboratory results.
CONCLUSIONS: This summarization app can be run in any EHR environment that either supports SMART or runs SMART-enabled i2b2. This i2b2 "clinical bridge" demonstrates a pathway for reusable app development that does not require EHR vendors to immediately adopt the SMART API. Apps can be developed in SMART and run by clinicians in the i2b2 repository, reusing clinical data extracted from EHRs. This may encourage the adoption of SMART by supporting SMART app development until EHRs adopt the platform. It also allows a new variety of clinical SMART apps, fueled by the broad aggregation of data types available in research repositories. The app (including its knowledge base) and SMART-i2b2 are open-source and freely available for download.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The impact of AKI on adverse drug events and therapeutic failures and the medication errors leading to these events have not been well described.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: A single-center observational study of 396 hospitalized patients with a minimum 0.5 mg/dl change in serum creatinine who were prescribed a nephrotoxic or renally eliminated medication was conducted. The population was stratified into two groups by the direction of their initial serum creatinine change: AKI and AKI recovery. Adverse drug events, potential adverse drug events, therapeutic failures, and potential therapeutic failures for 148 drugs and 46 outcomes were retrospectively measured. Events were classified for preventability and severity by expert adjudication. Multivariable analysis identified medication classes predisposing AKI patients to adverse drug events.
RESULTS: Forty-three percent of patients experienced a potential adverse drug event, adverse drug event, therapeutic failure, or potential therapeutic failure; 66\% of study events were preventable. Failure to adjust for kidney function (63\%) and use of nephrotoxic medications during AKI (28\%) were the most common potential adverse drug events. Worsening AKI and hypotension were the most common preventable adverse drug events. Most adverse drug events were considered serious (63\%) or life-threatening (31\%), with one fatal adverse drug event. Among AKI patients, administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, antibiotics, and antithrombotics was most strongly associated with the development of an adverse drug event or potential adverse drug event.
CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug events and potential therapeutic failures are common and frequently severe in patients with AKI exposed to nephrotoxic or renally eliminated medications.},

Technologies like automated summarization tools, EHR search engines and natural language processing have been shown to help clinicians manage this information.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based system for identifying EHR progress notes pertaining to diabetes, and to validate it at two institutions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved 2000 EHR progress notes from patients with diabetes at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (1000 for training and 1000 for testing) and another 1000 notes from the University of Texas Physicians (for validation). We manually annotated all notes and trained a SVM using a bag of words approach. We then used the SVM on the testing and validation sets and evaluated its performance with the area under the curve (AUC) and F statistics.
RESULTS: The model accurately identified diabetes-related notes in both the Brigham and Women's Hospital testing set (AUC=0.956, F=0.934) and the external University of Texas Faculty Physicians validation set (AUC=0.947, F=0.935).
DISCUSSION: Overall, the model we developed was quite accurate. Furthermore, it generalized, without loss of accuracy, to another institution with a different EHR and a distinct patient and provider population.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use a SVM-based classifier to identify EHR progress notes pertaining to diabetes, and the model generalizes well.},

Training sets size ranged from 2,000-10,000 randomly selected record-pairs. We also evaluated marginal uncertainty sampling for active learning. Optimization reduced manual review size (Deterministic 11.6\% vs. 2.5\%; FIE 49.6\% vs. 1.9\%; and Probabilistic 10.5\% vs. 3.5\%). FIE classified 98.1\% of the records correctly (precision=1.0). Best performance required training on all 10,000 randomly-selected record-pairs. Active learning achieved comparable results with 3,000 records.

	doi = {10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001744},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Clinical databases require accurate entity resolution (ER). One approach is to use algorithms that assign questionable cases to manual review. Few studies have compared the performance of common algorithms for such a task. Furthermore, previous work has been limited by a lack of objective methods for setting algorithm parameters. We compared the performance of common ER algorithms: using algorithmic optimization, rather than manual parameter tuning, and on two-threshold classification (match/manual review/non-match) as well as single-threshold (match/non-match).
METHODS: We manually reviewed 20,000 randomly selected, potential duplicate record-pairs to identify matches (10,000 training set, 10,000 test set). We evaluated the probabilistic expectation maximization, simple deterministic and fuzzy inference engine (FIE) algorithms. We used particle swarm to optimize algorithm parameters for a single and for two thresholds. We ran 10 iterations of optimization using the training set and report averaged performance against the test set.
RESULTS: The overall estimated duplicate rate was 6\%. FIE and simple deterministic algorithms allowed a lower manual review set compared to the probabilistic method (FIE 1.9\%, simple deterministic 2.5\%, probabilistic 3.6\%; p{\textless}0.001). For a single threshold, the simple deterministic algorithm performed better than the probabilistic method (positive predictive value 0.956 vs 0.887, sensitivity 0.985 vs 0.887, p{\textless}0.001). ER with FIE classifies 98.1\% of record-pairs correctly (1/10,000 error rate), assigning the remainder to manual review.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimized deterministic algorithms outperform the probabilistic method. There is a strong case for considering optimized deterministic methods for ER.},

DATA SOURCE: Medicare Electronic Health Record Incentive Program Eligible Professionals Public Use File (PUF), which contains data on meaningful use attestations by 237,267 eligible providers through May 31, 2013.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of the 15 core and 10 menu measures pertaining to use of EHR functions reported in the PUF.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Providers in the dataset performed strongly on all core measures, with the most frequent response for each of the 15 measures being 90-100 percent compliance, even when the threshold for a particular measure was lower (e.g., 30 percent). PCPs had higher scores than specialists for computerized order entry, maintaining an active medication list, and documenting vital signs, while specialists had higher scores for maintaining a problem list, recording patient demographics and smoking status, and for providing patients with an after-visit summary. In fact, 90.2 percent of eligible providers claimed at least one exclusion, and half claimed two or more.
CONCLUSIONS: Providers are successfully attesting to CMS's requirements, and often exceeding the thresholds required by CMS; however, some troubling patterns in exclusions are present. CMS should raise program requirements in future years.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation of data within electronic health records is necessary for implementation of various clinical decision support functions, including patient summarization. A key type of correlation is linking medications to clinical problems; while some databases of problem-medication links are available, they are not robust and depend on problems and medications being encoded in particular terminologies. Crowdsourcing represents one approach to generating robust knowledge bases across a variety of terminologies, but more sophisticated approaches are necessary to improve accuracy and reduce manual data review requirements.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop and evaluate a clinician reputation metric to facilitate the identification of appropriate problem-medication pairs through crowdsourcing without requiring extensive manual review.
APPROACH: We retrieved medications from our clinical data warehouse that had been prescribed and manually linked to one or more problems by clinicians during e-prescribing between June 1, 2010 and May 31, 2011. We identified measures likely to be associated with the percentage of accurate problem-medication links made by clinicians. Using logistic regression, we created a metric for identifying clinicians who had made greater than or equal to 95\% appropriate links. We evaluated the accuracy of the approach by comparing links made by those physicians identified as having appropriate links to a previously manually validated subset of problem-medication pairs.
RESULTS: Of 867 clinicians who asserted a total of 237,748 problem-medication links during the study period, 125 had a reputation metric that predicted the percentage of appropriate links greater than or equal to 95\%. These clinicians asserted a total of 2464 linked problem-medication pairs (983 distinct pairs). Compared to a previously validated set of problem-medication pairs, the reputation metric achieved a specificity of 99.5\% and marginally improved the sensitivity of previously described knowledge bases.
CONCLUSION: A reputation metric may be a valuable measure for identifying high quality clinician-entered, crowdsourced data.},

	volume = {14},
	issn = {1524-5012},
	shorttitle = {Clinical decision support alert appropriateness},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many healthcare providers are adopting clinical decision support (CDS) systems to improve patient safety and meet meaningful use requirements. Computerized alerts that prompt clinicians about drug-allergy, drug-drug, and drug-disease warnings or provide dosing guidance are most commonly implemented. Alert overrides, which occur when clinicians do not follow the guidance presented by the alert, can hinder improved patient outcomes.
METHODS: We present a review of CDS alerts and describe a proposal to develop novel methods for evaluating and improving CDS alerts that builds upon traditional informatics approaches. Our proposal incorporates previously described models for predicting alert overrides that utilize retrospective chart review to determine which alerts are clinically relevant and which overrides are justifiable.
RESULTS: Despite increasing implementations of CDS alerts, detailed evaluations rarely occur because of the extensive labor involved in manual chart reviews to determine alert and response appropriateness. Further, most studies have solely evaluated alert overrides that are appropriate or justifiable. Our proposal expands the use of web-based monitoring tools with an interactive dashboard for evaluating CDS alert and response appropriateness that incorporates the predictive models. The dashboard provides 2 views, an alert detail view and a patient detail view, to provide a full history of alerts and help put the patient's events in context.
CONCLUSION: The proposed research introduces several innovations to address the challenges and gaps in alert evaluations. This research can transform alert evaluation processes across healthcare settings, leading to improved CDS, reduced alert fatigue, and increased patient safety.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Therapy for certain medical conditions occurs in a stepwise fashion, where one medication is recommended as initial therapy and other medications follow. Sequential pattern mining is a data mining technique used to identify patterns of ordered events.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sequential pattern mining is effective for identifying temporal relationships between medications and accurately predicting the next medication likely to be prescribed for a patient.
DESIGN: We obtained claims data from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas for patients prescribed at least one diabetes medication between 2008 and 2011, and divided these into a training set (90\% of patients) and test set (10\% of patients). We applied the CSPADE algorithm to mine sequential patterns of diabetes medication prescriptions both at the drug class and generic drug level and ranked them by the support statistic. We then evaluated the accuracy of predictions made for which diabetes medication a patient was likely to be prescribed next.
RESULTS: We identified 161,497 patients who had been prescribed at least one diabetes medication. We were able to mine stepwise patterns of pharmacological therapy that were consistent with guidelines. Within three attempts, we were able to predict the medication prescribed for 90.0\% of patients when making predictions by drug class, and for 64.1\% when making predictions at the generic drug level. These results were stable under 10-fold cross validation, ranging from 89.1\%-90.5\% at the drug class level and 63.5-64.9\% at the generic drug level. Using 1 or 2 items in the patient's medication history led to more accurate predictions than not using any history, but using the entire history was sometimes worse.
CONCLUSION: Sequential pattern mining is an effective technique to identify temporal relationships between medications and can be used to predict next steps in a patient's medication regimen. Accurate predictions can be made without using the patient's entire medication history.},

METHODS: We evaluated the CDS implementation capabilities of 8 Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology Authorized Certification Body (ONC-ACB)-certified EHRs. Within each EHR, the authors attempted to implement 3 user-defined rules that utilized the various data and logic elements expected of typical EHRs and that represented clinically important evidenced-based care. The rules were: 1) if a patient has amiodarone on his or her active medication list and does not have a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) result recorded in the last 12 months, suggest ordering a TSH; 2) if a patient has a hemoglobin A1c result {\textgreater}7\% and does not have diabetes on his or her problem list, suggest adding diabetes to the problem list; and 3) if a patient has coronary artery disease on his or her problem list and does not have aspirin on the active medication list, suggest ordering aspirin.
RESULTS: Most evaluated EHRs lacked some CDS capabilities; 5 EHRs were able to implement all 3 rules, and the remaining 3 EHRs were unable to implement any of the rules. One of these did not allow users to customize CDS rules at all. The most frequently found shortcomings included the inability to use laboratory test results in rules, limit rules by time, use advanced Boolean logic, perform actions from the alert interface, and adequately test rules.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess problem list completeness using an objective measure across a range of sites, and to identify success factors for problem list completeness.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data and interviews at ten healthcare organizations within the United States, United Kingdom, and Argentina who use a variety of electronic health record systems: four self-developed and six commercial. At each site, we assessed the proportion of patients who have diabetes recorded on their problem list out of all patients with a hemoglobin A1c elevation{\textgreater}=7.0\%, which is diagnostic of diabetes. We then conducted interviews with informatics leaders at the four highest performing sites to determine factors associated with success. Finally, we surveyed all the sites about common practices implemented at the top performing sites to determine whether there was an association between problem list management practices and problem list completeness.
RESULTS: Problem list completeness across the ten sites ranged from 60.2\% to 99.4\%, with a mean of 78.2\%. Financial incentives, problem-oriented charting, gap reporting, shared responsibility, links to billing codes, and organizational culture were identified as success factors at the four hospitals with problem list completeness at or near 90.0\%.
DISCUSSION: Incomplete problem lists represent a global data integrity problem that could compromise quality of care and put patients at risk. There was a wide range of problem list completeness across the healthcare facilities. Nevertheless, some facilities have achieved high levels of problem list completeness, and it is important to better understand the factors that contribute to success to improve patient safety.
CONCLUSION: Problem list completeness varies substantially across healthcare facilities. In our review of EHR systems at ten healthcare facilities, we identified six success factors which may be useful for healthcare organizations seeking to improve the quality of their problem list documentation: financial incentives, problem oriented charting, gap reporting, shared responsibility, links to billing codes, and organizational culture.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The United States Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology sponsored the development of a "high-priority" list of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) to be used for clinical decision support. We assessed current adoption of this list and current alerting practice for these DDIs with regard to alert implementation (presence or absence of an alert) and display (alert appearance as interruptive or passive).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted evaluations of electronic health records (EHRs) at a convenience sample of health care organizations across the United States using a standardized testing protocol with simulated orders.
RESULTS: Evaluations of 19 systems were conducted at 13 sites using 14 different EHRs. Across systems, 69\% of the high-priority DDI pairs produced alerts. Implementation and display of the DDI alerts tested varied between systems, even when the same EHR vendor was used. Across the drug pairs evaluated, implementation and display of DDI alerts differed, ranging from 27\% (4/15) to 93\% (14/15) implementation.
DISCUSSION: Currently, there is no standard of care covering which DDI alerts to implement or how to display them to providers. Opportunities to improve DDI alerting include using differential displays based on DDI severity, establishing improved lists of clinically significant DDIs, and thoroughly reviewing organizational implementation decisions regarding DDIs.
CONCLUSION: DDI alerting is clinically important but not standardized. There is significant room for improvement and standardization around evidence-based DDIs.},

Previous initiatives to calculate ambulatory quality measures have relied on billing data or individual electronic health records (EHRs) to calculate and report performance. New methods for quality measure calculation promoted by federal regulations allow qualified clinical data registries to report quality outcomes based on data aggregated across facilities and EHRs using interoperability standards.
OBJECTIVE: This research evaluates the use of clinical document interchange standards as the basis for quality measurement.
METHODS: Using data on 1,100 patients from 11 ambulatory care facilities and 5 different EHRs, challenges to quality measurement are identified and addressed for 17 certified quality measures.
RESULTS: Iterative solutions were identified for 14 measures that improved patient inclusion and measure calculation accuracy. Findings validate this approach to improving measure accuracy while maintaining measure certification.
CONCLUSION: Organizations that report care quality should be aware of how identified issues affect quality measure selection and calculation. Quality measure authors should consider increasing real-world validation and the consistency of measure logic in respect to issues identified in this research.},

METHODS: Changes in the percentage of providers with positive perceptions of EHR benefit were captured via a survey of academic health care providers before (baseline) and at 6-12 months (short term) and 12-24 months (long term) after the transition. We analyzed 32 items for the overall group and by practice setting, provider age, and specialty using separate multivariable-adjusted random effects logistic regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 223 providers completed all 3 surveys (30\% response rate): 85.6\% had outpatient practices, 56.5\% were {\textgreater}45 years old, and 23.8\% were primary care providers. The percentage of providers with positive perceptions significantly increased from baseline to long-term follow-up for patient communication, hospital transitions - access to clinical information, preventive care delivery, preventive care prompt, preventive lab prompt, satisfaction with system reliability, and sharing medical information (P {\textless} .05 for each). The percentage of providers with positive perceptions significantly decreased over time for overall satisfaction, productivity, better patient care, clinical decision quality, easy access to patient information, monitoring patients, more time for patients, coordination of care, computer access, adequate resources, and satisfaction with ease of use (P {\textless} 0.05 for each). Results varied by subgroup.
CONCLUSION: After a transition to a commercial comprehensive EHR, items with significant increases and significant decreases in the percentage of providers with positive perceptions of EHR benefit were identified, overall and by subgroup.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Developing effective and reliable rule-based clinical decision support (CDS) alerts and reminders is challenging. Using a previously developed taxonomy for alert malfunctions, we identified best practices for developing, testing, implementing, and maintaining alerts and avoiding malfunctions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 72 initial practices from the literature, interviews with subject matter experts, and prior research. To refine, enrich, and prioritize the list of practices, we used the Delphi method with two rounds of consensus-building and refinement. We used a larger than normal panel of experts to include a wide representation of CDS subject matter experts from various disciplines.
RESULTS: 28 experts completed Round 1 and 25 completed Round 2. Round 1 narrowed the list to 47 best practices in 7 categories: knowledge management, designing and specifying, building, testing, deployment, monitoring and feedback, and people and governance. Round 2 developed consensus on the importance and feasibility of each best practice.
DISCUSSION: The Delphi panel identified a range of best practices that may help to improve implementation of rule-based CDS and avert malfunctions. Due to limitations on resources and personnel, not everyone can implement all best practices. The most robust processes require investing in a data warehouse. Experts also pointed to the issue of shared responsibility between the healthcare organization and the electronic health record vendor.
CONCLUSION: These 47 best practices represent an ideal situation. The research identifies the balance between importance and difficulty, highlights the challenges faced by organizations seeking to implement CDS, and describes several opportunities for future research to reduce alert malfunctions.},

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review by searching PubMed and Google Scholar for studies on ADEs detected in the ambulatory setting involving any EHR use published before June 2017. We extracted study characteristics from included studies related to ADE detection methods for analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 30 studies that evaluated ADEs in an ambulatory setting with an EHR. In 27 studies, EHRs were used only as the data source for ADE identification. In two studies, the EHR was used as both a data source and to deliver decision support to providers during order entry. In one study, the EHR was a source of data and generated patient safety reports that researchers used in the process of identifying ADEs. Methods of identification included manual chart review by trained nurses, pharmacists, and/or physicians; prescription review; computer monitors; electronic triggers; International Classification of Diseases codes; natural language processing of clinical notes; and patient phone calls and surveys. Seven studies provided examples of search phrases, laboratory values, and rules used to identify ADEs.
CONCLUSION: The majority of studies examined used EHRs as sources of data for ADE detection. This retrospective approach is appropriate to measure incidence rates of ADEs but not adequate to detect preventable ADEs before patient harm occurs. New methods involving computer monitors and electronic triggers will enable researchers to catch preventable ADEs and take corrective action.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study sought to determine availability and use of structured override reasons for drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts in electronic health records.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data on DDI alerts and override reasons from 10 clinical sites across the United States using a variety of electronic health records. We used a multistage iterative card sort method to categorize the override reasons from all sites and identified best practices.
RESULTS: Our methodology established 177 unique override reasons across the 10 sites. The number of coded override reasons at each site ranged from 3 to 100. Many sites offered override reasons not relevant to DDIs. Twelve categories of override reasons were identified. Three categories accounted for 78\% of all overrides: "will monitor or take precautions," "not clinically significant," and "benefit outweighs risk."
DISCUSSION: We found wide variability in override reasons between sites and many opportunities to improve alerts. Some override reasons were irrelevant to DDIs. Many override reasons attested to a future action (eg, decreasing a dose or ordering monitoring tests), which requires an additional step after the alert is overridden, unless the alert is made actionable. Some override reasons deferred to another party, although override reasons often are not visible to other users. Many override reasons stated that the alert was inaccurate, suggesting that specificity of alerts could be improved.
CONCLUSIONS: Organizations should improve the options available to providers who choose to override DDI alerts. DDI alerting systems should be actionable and alerts should be tailored to the patient and drug pairs.},

Although single-site studies are important early in the innovation lifecycle, multisite studies of EHR interventions are critical for generalizability. Because EHR software, configuration, and local context differ considerably across health care organizations, it can be difficult to implement a single, standardized intervention across multiple sites in a study. This article outlines key strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities for standardization of EHR interventions in multisite studies and describes flexible trial designs suitable for studying complex interventions, including EHR interventions. It also outlines key considerations for reporting on flexible trials of EHR interventions, including sharing details of the process for designing interventions and their content, details of outcomes being studied and approaches for pooling, and the importance of sharing code and configuration whenever possible.},

STUDY DESIGN: Centers within the NPC-QIC were divided into tertiles based on early performance for mortality and separately for growth failure. These groups were evaluated for improvement from the early to late time period and compared with the other groups in the late time period.
RESULTS: Mortality was 3.8\% for the high-performing, 7.6\% for the medium-performing, and 14.4\% for the low-performing groups in the early time period. Only the low-performing group had a significant change (P {\textless} .001) from the early to late period. In the late period, there was no difference in mortality between the high- (5.7\%), medium- (7\%), and low- (4.6\%) performing centers (P = .5). Growth failure occurred in 13.9\% for the high-performing, 21.9\% for the medium-performing, and 32.8\% for the low-performing groups in the early time period.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical decision support (CDS) can contribute to quality and safety. Prior work has shown that errors in CDS systems are common and can lead to unintended consequences. Many CDS systems use Boolean logic, which can be difficult for CDS analysts to specify accurately. We set out to determine the prevalence of certain types of Boolean logic errors in CDS statements.
METHODS: Nine health care organizations extracted Boolean logic statements from their Epic electronic health record (EHR). We developed an open-source software tool, which implemented the Espresso logic minimization algorithm, to identify three classes of logic errors.
RESULTS: Participating organizations submitted 260,698 logic statements, of which 44,890 were minimized by Espresso. We found errors in 209 of them. Every participating organization had at least two errors, and all organizations reported that they would act on the feedback.
DISCUSSION: An automated algorithm can readily detect specific categories of Boolean CDS logic errors. These errors represent a minority of CDS errors, but very likely require correction to avoid patient safety issues. This process found only a few errors at each site, but the problem appears to be widespread, affecting all participating organizations.
CONCLUSION: Both CDS implementers and EHR vendors should consider implementing similar algorithms as part of the CDS authoring process to reduce the number of errors in their CDS interventions.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study to identify case subjects with COVID-19 across a regional health care network of 137 service locations. Using an electronic health record query, chart review, and patient contact, we identified clinical factors influencing illness severity.
RESULTS: We identified COVID-19 in 6,138, 40, and 273 patients without diabetes and with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Compared with not having diabetes, people with type 1 diabetes had adjusted odds ratios of 3.90 (95\% CI 1.75-8.69) for hospitalization and 3.35 (95\% CI 1.53-7.33) for greater illness severity, which was similar to risk in type 2 diabetes. Among patients with type 1 diabetes, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, race, recent diabetic ketoacidosis, health insurance status, and less diabetes technology use were significantly associated with illness severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes status, both type 1 and type 2, independently increases the adverse impacts of COVID-19. Potentially modifiable factors (e.g., HbA1c) had significant but modest impact compared with comparatively static factors (e.g., race and insurance) in type 1 diabetes, indicating an urgent and continued need to mitigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection risk in this community.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Documentation burden is a common problem with modern electronic health record (EHR) systems. To reduce this burden, various recording methods (eg, voice recorders or motion sensors) have been proposed. However, these solutions are in an early prototype phase and are unlikely to transition into practice in the near future. A more pragmatic alternative is to directly modify the implementation of the existing functionalities of an EHR system.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the nature of free-text comments entered into EHR flowsheets that supplement quantitative vital sign values and examine opportunities to simplify functionality and reduce documentation burden.
METHODS: We evaluated 209,055 vital sign comments in flowsheets that were generated in the Epic EHR system at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 2018. We applied topic modeling, as well as the natural language processing Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing software system, to extract generally discussed topics and detailed medical terms (expressed as probability distribution) to investigate the stories communicated in these comments.
RESULTS: Our analysis showed that 63.33\% (6053/9557) of the users who entered vital signs made at least one free-text comment in vital sign flowsheet entries. The user roles that were most likely to compose comments were registered nurse, technician, and licensed nurse. The most frequently identified topics were the notification of a result to health care providers (0.347), the context of a measurement (0.307), and an inability to obtain a vital sign (0.224). There were 4187 unique medical terms that were extracted from 46,029 (0.220) comments, including many symptom-related terms such as "pain," "upset," "dizziness," "coughing," "anxiety," "distress," and "fever" and drug-related terms such as "tylenol," "anesthesia," "cannula," "oxygen," "motrin," "rituxan," and "labetalol."
CONCLUSIONS: Considering that flowsheet comments are generally not displayed or automatically pulled into any clinical notes, our findings suggest that the flowsheet comment functionality can be simplified (eg, via structured response fields instead of a text input dialog) to reduce health care provider effort. Moreover, rich and clinically important medical terms such as medications and symptoms should be explicitly recorded in clinical notes for better visibility.},

A novel CDS was sought for the APOL1, NAT2, and YEATS4 genes to guide optimal selection of antihypertensive medications among the African American population cared for at multiple participating institutions in a clinical trial. (2) Methods: The CDS committee, made up of clinical content and CDS experts, developed a framework and contributed to the creation of the CDS using the following guiding principles: 1. medical algorithm consensus; 2. actionability; 3. context-sensitive triggers; 4. workflow integration; 5. feasibility; 6. interpretability; 7. portability; and 8. discrete reporting of lab results. (3) Results: Utilizing the principle of discrete patient laboratory and vital information, a novel CDS for APOL1, NAT2, and YEATS4 was created for use in a multi-institutional trial based on a medical algorithm consensus. The alerts are actionable and easily interpretable, clearly displaying the purpose and recommendations with pertinent laboratory results, vitals and links to ordersets with suggested antihypertensive dosages. Alerts were either triggered immediately once a provider starts to order relevant antihypertensive agents or strategically placed in workflow-appropriate general CDS sections in the electronic health record (EHR). Detailed implementation instructions were shared across institutions to achieve maximum portability. (4) Conclusions: Using sound principles, the created genetic algorithms were applied across multiple institutions. The framework outlined in this study should apply to other disease-gene and pharmacogenomic projects employing CDS.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Kidney stone recurrence rates vary between patients. A patient's risk informs the frequency and intensity of preventative interventions. Clinicians routinely use clinical experience to estimate risk. We sought to compare clinician estimated recurrence risk with the recurrence of kidney stones (ROKS) nomogram. Materials and Methods: We surveyed members of the Endourological Society with clinical expertise in kidney stones. Respondents estimated the risk of recurrence for patients in three clinical vignettes corresponding to low, intermediate, and high recurrence risk from the nomogram. Clinician estimates were compared with ROKS estimates. Results: The majority of the 318 respondents were from North America (n = 127, 40\%). The most commonly estimated recurrence was 50\% at 5 years. The respondents' estimates were significantly different from the ROKS predicted recurrence rate for all cases (Case 1, 50\% vs 93\% p {\textless} 0.0001; Case 2, 50\% vs 60\% p {\textless} 0.0001; Case 3, 60\% vs 22\% p {\textless} 0.0001). The ROKS predicted estimates ranged from 22\% to 93\%, whereas the median urologist-derived 5-year risk estimates for each case ranged from 50\% to 60\%. The median range of estimates by respondents across cases was 20\%, narrower than the 71\% for the ROKS nomogram. The majority of respondents (95\%) do not use nomograms in practice, mostly because of lack of awareness of useful nomograms (59\%). Conclusions: This study suggests that clinicians may not be able to distinguish those with high and low recurrence risk when compared with peers and when compared with a nomogram. Clinical decision support tools are needed to enable clinicians to better estimate stone recurrence risk.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Accurate and robust quality measurement is critical to the future of value-based care. Having incomplete information when calculating quality measures can cause inaccuracies in reported patient outcomes. This research examines how quality calculations vary when using data from an individual electronic health record (EHR) and longitudinal data from a health information exchange (HIE) operating as a multisource registry for quality measurement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were sampled from 53 healthcare organizations in 2018. Organizations represented both ambulatory care practices and health systems participating in the state of Kansas HIE. Fourteen ambulatory quality measures for 5300 patients were calculated using the data from an individual EHR source and contrasted to calculations when HIE data were added to locally recorded data.
RESULTS: A total of 79\% of patients received care at more than 1 facility during the 2018 calendar year. A total of 12 994 applicable quality measure calculations were compared using data from the originating organization vs longitudinal data from the HIE. A total of 15\% of all quality measure calculations changed (P {\textless} .001) when including HIE data sources, affecting 19\% of patients. Changes in quality measure calculations were observed across measures and organizations.
DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that quality measures calculated using single-site EHR data may be limited by incomplete information. Effective data sharing significantly changes quality calculations, which affect healthcare payments, patient safety, and care quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Federal, state, and commercial programs that use quality measurement as part of reimbursement could promote more accurate and representative quality measurement through methods that increase clinical data sharing.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prolonged pre-procedural fasting in children is associated with decreased patient and family satisfaction and increased patient hemodynamic instability. Practice guidelines recommend clear liquid fasting times of 2 h. We aimed to decrease pre-procedural clear liquid fasting time from 10 h 13 min to 5 h for pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) patients.
METHODS: All children admitted to the PHM service at a quaternary care children's hospital with an NPO (nil per os) order associated with a procedure requiring general anesthesia or sedation from November 2, 2017 to September 19, 2021 were included. The primary outcome measure was the average time from clear liquid fasting end time to anesthesia start time. The process measure was the percent of NPO orders including a documented clear liquid fasting end time. Balancing measures were aspiration events and case delays/cancellations. Statistical process control charts were used to analyze outcomes.
RESULTS: Shortly after implementation of a SmartPhrase in the NPO order, there was special cause variation resulting in a centerline shift from a mean of 10 h 13 min to 6 h 37 min and an increase in the process measure from a baseline of 2\%-52\%. Following implementation of a hospital-wide change to the NPO order format, another centerline shift to 6 h 7 min occurred which has been sustained for 6 months. No aspiration events and four NPO violations occurred during the intervention period.
CONCLUSION: Quality improvement methodology and higher reliability interventions safely decreased the average pre-procedural fasting time in hospitalized children.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current state of problem list maintenance at an academic medical center.
SUMMARY: We included problem list data for patients who had at least 2 face-to-face encounters at Vanderbilt University Medical Center or its clinics between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. We used the frequency of problem list additions, resolutions, deletions, duplicate problems (exact and SNOMED CT duplicates), inconsistencies (contradicting stages of disease state), and items that could be documented elsewhere in the electronic health record as surrogate markers of problem list maintenance. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results. A total of 546,510 patients met inclusion criteria. There were 3,762 (0.7\%) patients who had the exact same active problem listed more than once. SNOMED CT code duplications occurred in the records for 56,399 (10.5\%) patients. Of the patients with asthma, 2.5\% (223/8,779) had contradicting asthma stages active on their problem list, and 6.4\% (950/14,950) of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had contradicting CKD stages. In addition, 17,205 (3.1\%) patients had 20,365 active family history problems and 39,464 (7.2\%) patients had an allergy documented on their problem list. On average, there were 43.7 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 14-73.4) additions, 8.7 (95\% CI, 0.1-17.4) resolutions, and 2.1 (95\% CI, 0-4.6) deletions of problems per 100 face-to-face encounters, inpatient or outpatient.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests areas for improvement for problem list maintenance. Further studies into semantic duplication and clinical decision support tools to encourage problem list maintenance and deduplication are needed.},

METHODS: Data were collected from March to July 2020 in a tertiary care adult IBD clinic that was transitioned to a fully telehealth model. A protocol for telehealth was implemented. A retrospective analysis was performed using electronic medical record (EMR) data. All patients were scheduled for video telehealth. If this failed, providers attempted to conduct the visit as audio only.
RESULTS: Between March and July 2020, 2571 telehealth visits were scheduled for adult patients with IBD. Of these, 2498 (99\%) were successfully completed by video or phone. Sixty percent were female, and the median age was 41 years. Eighty six percent of the population was white, 8\% black, 2\% other, and 4\% were missing. Seventy-five percent had commercial insurance, 15\% had Medicare, 5\% had Medicaid, and 5\% had other insurance. No significant factors were found for an attempted but completely failed visit. Using a multivariate logistic regression model, increasing age (odds ratio, 1.80; 95\% CI, 1.55-2.08; P {\textless} 0.05), noncommercial insurance status (odds ratio, 1.89; 95\% CI, 1.61-2.21; P {\textless} 0.05), and black race (odds ratio, 2.07; 95\% CI, 1.38-3.08; P {\textless} 0.05) increased the likelihood of a video encounter failure.

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Understanding the differences and potential synergies between traditional clinician assessment and automated machine learning might enable more accurate and useful suicide risk detection.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the respective and combined abilities of a real-time machine learning model and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) to predict suicide attempt (SA) and suicidal ideation (SI).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included encounters with adult patients (aged ≥18 years) at a major academic medical center. The C-SSRS was administered during routine care, and a Vanderbilt Suicide Attempt and Ideation Likelihood (VSAIL) prediction was generated in the electronic health record. Encounters took place in the inpatient, ambulatory surgical, and emergency department settings. Data were collected from June 2019 to September 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the incidence of SA and SI, encoded as International Classification of Diseases codes, occurring within various time periods after an index visit. We evaluated the retrospective validity of the C-SSRS, VSAIL, and ensemble models combining both. Discrimination metrics included area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).
RESULTS: The cohort included 120 398 unique index visits for 83 394 patients (mean [SD] age, 51.2 [20.6] years; 38 107 [46\%] men; 45 273 [54\%] women; 13 644 [16\%] Black; 63 869 [77\%] White). Within 30 days of an index visit, the combined models had higher AUROC (SA: 0.874-0.887; SI: 0.869-0.879) than both the VSAIL (SA: 0.729; SI: 0.773) and C-SSRS (SA: 0.823; SI: 0.777) models. In the highest risk-decile, ensemble methods had PPV of 1.3\% to 1.4\% for SA and 8.3\% to 8.7\% for SI and sensitivity of 77.6\% to 79.5\% for SA and 67.4\% to 70.1\% for SI, outperforming VSAIL (PPV for SA: 0.4\%; PPV for SI: 3.9\%; sensitivity for SA: 28.8\%; sensitivity for SI: 35.1\%) and C-SSRS (PPV for SA: 0.5\%; PPV for SI: 3.5\%; sensitivity for SA: 76.6\%; sensitivity for SI: 68.8\%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, suicide risk prediction was optimal when leveraging both in-person screening (for acute measures of risk in patient-reported suicidality) and historical EHR data (for underlying clinical factors that can quantify a patient's passive risk level). To improve suicide risk classification, prediction systems could combine pretrained machine learning with structured clinician assessment without needing to retrain the original model.},

We completed descriptive analyses of the changes made to alerts during the process, and of alert firing rates before and after the program.
RESULTS: Prior to Clickbusters, VUMC had 419 CDS alerts in production, with 488 425 firings (42 982 interruptive) each week. After 2 rounds, the Clickbusters program resulted in detailed, comprehensive reviews of 84 CDS alerts and reduced the number of weekly alert firings by more than 70 000 (15.43\%). In addition to the direct improvements in CDS, the initiative also increased user engagement and involvement in CDS.
CONCLUSIONS: At VUMC, the Clickbusters program was successful in optimizing CDS alerts by reducing alert firings and resulting clicks. The program also involved more users in the process of evaluating and improving CDS and helped build a culture of continuous evaluation and improvement of clinical content in the electronic health record.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients taking high doses of opioids, or taking opioids in combination with other central nervous system depressants, are at increased risk of opioid overdose. Coprescribing the opioid-reversal agent naloxone is an essential safety measure, recommended by the surgeon general, but the rate of naloxone coprescribing is low. Therefore, we set out to determine whether a targeted clinical decision support alert could increase the rate of naloxone coprescribing.
METHODS: We conducted a before-after study from January 2019 to April 2021 at a large academic health system in the Southeast. We developed a targeted point of care decision support notification in the electronic health record to suggest ordering naloxone for patients who have a high risk of opioid overdose based on a high morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) ≥90 mg, concomitant benzodiazepine prescription, or a history of opioid use disorder or opioid overdose. We measured the rate of outpatient naloxone prescribing as our primary measure. A multivariable logistic regression model with robust variance to adjust for prescriptions within the same prescriber was implemented to estimate the association between alerts and naloxone coprescribing.
RESULTS: The baseline naloxone coprescribing rate in 2019 was 0.28 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.31) naloxone prescriptions per 100 opioid prescriptions. After alert implementation, the naloxone coprescribing rate increased to 4.51 (95\% CI, 4.33-4.68) naloxone prescriptions per 100 opioid prescriptions (P {\textless} .001). The adjusted odds of naloxone coprescribing after alert implementation were approximately 28 times those during the baseline period (95\% CI, 15-52).
CONCLUSIONS: A targeted decision support alert for patients at risk for opioid overdose significantly increased the rate of naloxone coprescribing and was relatively easy to build.},

METHODS: Two organizations implemented similar real-time feedback tools and processes in their electronic health record and gathered data over a 30-month period. At both sites, users could provide feedback by using Likert feedback links embedded in all end-user facing alerts, with results stored outside the electronic health record, and provide feedback as a comment when they overrode an alert. Both systems are monitored daily by clinical informatics teams.
RESULTS: The two sites received 2,639 Likert feedback comments and 623,270 override comments over a 30-month period. Through four case studies, we describe our use of end-user feedback to rapidly respond to build errors, as well as identifying inaccurate knowledge management, user-interface issues, and unique workflows.
CONCLUSION: Feedback on CDS tools can be solicited in multiple ways, and it contains valuable and actionable suggestions to improve CDS alerts. Additionally, end users appreciate knowing their feedback is being received and may also make other suggestions to improve the electronic health record. Incorporation of end-user feedback into CDS monitoring, evaluation, and remediation is a way to improve CDS.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and test an accurate deep learning model for predicting new onset delirium in hospitalized adult patients.
METHODS: Using electronic health record (EHR) data extracted from a large academic medical center, we developed a model combining long short-term memory (LSTM) and machine learning to predict new onset delirium and compared its performance with machine-learning-only models (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, neural network, and LightGBM). The labels of models were confusion assessment method (CAM) assessments. We evaluated models on a hold-out dataset. We calculated Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) measures to gauge the feature impact on the model.
RESULTS: A total of 331 489 CAM assessments with 896 features from 34 035 patients were included. The LightGBM model achieved the best performance (AUC 0.927 [0.924, 0.929] and F1 0.626 [0.618, 0.634]) among the machine learning models. When combined with the LSTM model, the final model's performance improved significantly (P = .001) with AUC 0.952 [0.950, 0.955] and F1 0.759 [0.755, 0.765]. The precision value of the combined model improved from 0.497 to 0.751 with a fixed recall of 0.8. Using the mean absolute SHAP values, we identified the top 20 features, including age, heart rate, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score, Morse fall risk score, pulse, respiratory rate, and level of care.
CONCLUSION: Leveraging LSTM to capture temporal trends and combining it with the LightGBM model can significantly improve the prediction of new onset delirium, providing an algorithmic basis for the subsequent development of clinical decision support tools for proactive delirium interventions.},

METHODS: We used a retrospective 5-year adult ED sample of 279,132 patients to explore using CP alone to predict ACS, then we incrementally added other ACS chief complaints, age, and sex in a series of multivariable logistic regression models. We evaluated each model's identification of ACS and STEMI.
RESULTS: Using CP alone would recommend ECGs for 8\% of patients (sensitivity, 61\%; specificity, 92\%) but missed 28.4\% of STEMIs. The model with all variables identified ECGs for 22\% of patients (sensitivity, 82\%; specificity, 78\%) but missed 14.7\% of STEMIs. The model with CP and other ACS chief complaints had the highest sensitivity (93\%) and specificity (55\%), identified 45.1\% of patients for ECG, and only missed 4.4\% of STEMIs.
CONCLUSION: CP alone had highest specificity but lacked sensitivity. Adding other ACS chief complaints increased sensitivity but identified 2.2-fold more patients for ECGs. Achieving an ECG in 10 min for patients with ACS to identify all STEMIs will be challenging without introducing more complex risk calculation into clinical care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if ChatGPT can generate useful suggestions for improving clinical decision support (CDS) logic and to assess noninferiority compared to human-generated suggestions.
METHODS: We supplied summaries of CDS logic to ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) tool for question answering that uses a large language model, and asked it to generate suggestions. We asked human clinician reviewers to review the AI-generated suggestions as well as human-generated suggestions for improving the same CDS alerts, and rate the suggestions for their usefulness, acceptance, relevance, understanding, workflow, bias, inversion, and redundancy.
RESULTS: Five clinicians analyzed 36 AI-generated suggestions and 29 human-generated suggestions for 7 alerts. Of the 20 suggestions that scored highest in the survey, 9 were generated by ChatGPT. The suggestions generated by AI were found to offer unique perspectives and were evaluated as highly understandable and relevant, with moderate usefulness, low acceptance, bias, inversion, redundancy.
CONCLUSION: AI-generated suggestions could be an important complementary part of optimizing CDS alerts, can identify potential improvements to alert logic and support their implementation, and may even be able to assist experts in formulating their own suggestions for CDS improvement. ChatGPT shows great potential for using large language models and reinforcement learning from human feedback to improve CDS alert logic and potentially other medical areas involving complex, clinical logic, a key step in the development of an advanced learning health system.},

OBJECTIVE: We sought to ascertain prevalence and correlates of CGM use and to examine rates of new CGM prescriptions across clinic types and medication regimens.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort using electronic health records in a large academic medical center in the Southeastern US.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with type 2 diabetes and a primary care or endocrinology visit during 2021.
MAIN MEASURES: Age, gender, race, ethnicity, insurance, clinic type, insulin regimen, hemoglobin A1c values, CGM prescriptions, and prescribing clinic type.
KEY RESULTS: Among 30,585 adults with type 2 diabetes, 13\% had used a CGM. CGM users were younger and more had private health insurance (p {\textless} .05) as compared to non-users; 72\% of CGM users had an intensive insulin regimen, but 12\% were not taking insulin. CGM users had higher hemoglobin A1c values (both most recent and most proximal to the first CGM prescription) than non-users. CGM users were more likely to receive endocrinology care than non-users, but 23\% had only primary care visits in 2021. For each month in 2021, a mean of 90.5 (SD 12.5) people started using CGM. From 2020 to 2021, monthly rates of CGM prescriptions to new users grew 36\% overall, but 125\% in primary care. Most starting CGM in endocrinology had an intensive insulin regimen (82\% vs. 49\% starting in primary care), whereas 28\% starting CGM in primary care were not using insulin (vs. 5\% in endocrinology).
CONCLUSION: CGM uptake for type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly, with most growth in primary care. These trends present opportunities for healthcare system adaptations to support CGM use and related workflows in primary care to support growth in uptake.},

This survey identifies current trends and synthesizes evidence-based recommendations and considerations for future development and implementation of CDS tools.
METHODS: We conducted a search in PubMed for literature published between 2020 and 2022. Our search strategy was constructed as a combination of the MEDLINE®/PubMed® Health Disparities and Minority Health Search Strategy and relevant CDS MeSH terms and phrases. We then extracted relevant data from the studies, including priority population when applicable, domain of influence on the disparity being addressed, and the type of CDS being used. We also made note of when a study discussed the digital divide in some capacity and organized the comments into general themes through group discussion.
RESULTS: Our search yielded 520 studies, with 45 included at the conclusion of screening. The most frequent CDS type in this review was point-of-care alerts/reminders (33.3\%). Health Care System was the most frequent domain of influence (71.1\%), and Blacks/African Americans were the most frequently included priority population (42.2\%). Throughout the literature, we found four general themes related to the technology divide: inaccessibility of technology, access to care, trust of technology, and technology literacy.This survey revealed the diversity of CDS being used to address health disparities and several barriers which may make CDS less effective or potentially harmful to certain populations. Regular examinations of literature that feature CDS and address health disparities can help to reveal new strategies and patterns for improving healthcare.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The need to rapidly implement telehealth at large scale during the COVID-19 pandemic led to many patients using telehealth for the first time. We assessed the effect of structured pre-visit preparatory telephone calls on success of telehealth visits and examined risk factors for unsuccessful visits.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out of 45,803 adult patients scheduled for a total of 64,447 telehealth appointments between March and July 2020 at an academic medical center. A subset of patients received a structured pre-visit phone call. Demographic factors and inclusion of a pre-visit call were analysed by logistic regression. Primary outcomes were non-completion of any visit and completion of phone-only versus audio-visual telehealth visits.
RESULTS: A pre-visit telephone call to a subset of patients significantly increased the likelihood of a successful telehealth visit (OR 0.54; 95\% CI: 0.48-0.60). Patients aged 18-30 years, those with non-commercial insurance or those of Black race were more likely to have incomplete visits. Compared to age 18-30, increasing age increased likelihood of a failed video visit: 31-50 years (OR 1.31; 95\% CI: 1.13-1.51), 51-70 years (OR 2.98; 2.60-3.42) and {\textgreater}70 years (OR 4.16; 3.58-4.82). Those with non-commercial insurance and those of Black race (OR 1.8; 95\% CI 1.67-1.92) were more likely to have a failed video visit.
DISCUSSION: A structured pre-call to patients improved the likelihood of a successful video visit during widespread adoption of telehealth. Structured pre-calls to patients may be an important tool to help reduce gaps in utilization among groups.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an approach that identifies patients eligible for lung cancer screening (LCS) by combining structured and unstructured smoking data from the electronic health record (EHR).
METHODS: We identified patients aged 50-80 years who had at least one encounter in a primary care clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) between 2019 and 2022. We fine-tuned an existing natural language processing (NLP) tool to extract quantitative smoking information using clinical notes collected from VUMC. Then, we developed an approach to identify patients who are eligible for LCS by combining smoking information from structured data and clinical narratives. We compared this method with two approaches to identify LCS eligibility only using smoking information from structured EHR. We used 50 patients with a documented history of tobacco use for comparison and validation.
RESULTS: 102,475 patients were included. The NLP-based approach achieved an F1-score of 0.909, and accuracy of 0.96. The baseline approach could identify 5,887 patients. Compared to the baseline approach, the number of identified patients using all structured data and the NLP-based algorithm was 7,194 (22.2 \%) and 10,231 (73.8 \%), respectively. The NLP-based approach identified 589 Black/African Americans, a significant increase of 119 \%.
CONCLUSION: We present a feasible NLP-based approach to identify LCS eligible patients. It provides a technical basis for the development of clinical decision support tools to potentially improve the utilization of LCS and diminish healthcare disparities.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Geocoding, the process of converting addresses into precise geographic coordinates, allows researchers and health systems to obtain neighborhood-level estimates of social determinants of health. This information supports opportunities to personalize care and interventions for individual patients based on the environments where they live. We developed an integrated offline geocoding pipeline to streamline the process of obtaining address-based variables, which can be integrated into existing data processing pipelines.
METHODS: POINT is a web-based, containerized, application for geocoding addresses that can be deployed offline and made available to multiple users across an organization. Our application supports use through both a graphical user interface and application programming interface to query geographic variables, by census tract, without exposing sensitive patient data. We evaluated our application's performance using two datasets: one consisting of 1 million nationally representative addresses sampled from Open Addresses, and the other consisting of 3,096 previously geocoded patient addresses.
RESULTS: A total of 99.4 and 99.8\% of addresses in the Open Addresses and patient addresses datasets, respectively, were geocoded successfully. Census tract assignment was concordant with reference in greater than 90\% of addresses for both datasets. Among successful geocodes, median (interquartile range) distances from reference coordinates were 52.5 (26.5-119.4) and 14.5 (10.9-24.6) m for the two datasets.
CONCLUSION: POINT successfully geocodes more addresses and yields similar accuracy to existing solutions, including the U.S. Census Bureau's official geocoder. Addresses are considered protected health information and cannot be shared with common online geocoding services. POINT is an offline solution that enables scalability to multiple users and integrates downstream mapping to neighborhood-level variables with a pipeline that allows users to incorporate additional datasets as they become available. As health systems and researchers continue to explore and improve health equity, it is essential to quickly and accurately obtain neighborhood variables in a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant way.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early detection of clinical deterioration among hospitalized patients is a clinical priority for patient safety and quality of care. Current automated approaches for identifying these patients perform poorly at identifying imminent events.
OBJECTIVE: Develop a machine learning algorithm using pager messages sent between clinical team members to predict imminent clinical deterioration.
DESIGN: We conducted a large observational study using long short-term memory machine learning models on the content and frequency of clinical pages.
PARTICIPANTS: We included all hospitalizations between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center that included at least one page message to physicians. Exclusion criteria included patients receiving palliative care, hospitalizations with a planned intensive care stay, and hospitalizations in the top 2\% longest length of stay.
MAIN MEASURES: Model classification performance to identify in-hospital cardiac arrest, transfer to intensive care, or Rapid Response activation in the next 3-, 6-, and 12-hours. We compared model performance against three common early warning scores: Modified Early Warning Score, National Early Warning Score, and the Epic Deterioration Index.
KEY RESULTS: There were 87,783 patients (mean [SD] age 54.0 [18.8] years; 45,835 [52.2\%] women) who experienced 136,778 hospitalizations. 6214 hospitalized patients experienced a deterioration event. The machine learning model accurately identified 62\% of deterioration events within 3-hours prior to the event and 47\% of events within 12-hours. Across each time horizon, the model surpassed performance of the best early warning score including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 6-hours (0.856 vs. 0.781), sensitivity at 6-hours (0.590 vs. 0.505), specificity at 6-hours (0.900 vs. 0.878), and F-score at 6-hours (0.291 vs. 0.220).
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning applied to the content and frequency of clinical pages improves prediction of imminent deterioration. Using clinical pages to monitor patient acuity supports improved detection of imminent deterioration without requiring changes to clinical workflow or nursing documentation.},

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the generalizability of these methods by validating them at an external site.
METHODS: We received data on medications and problems for 263,597 patients from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Faculty Practice, an ambulatory practice that uses the Allscripts Enterprise commercial electronic health record product. We then conducted association rule mining to identify associated pairs of medications and problems and characterized these associations with five measures of interestingness: support, confidence, chi-square, interest and conviction and compared the top-ranked pairs to a gold standard.
RESULTS: 25,088 medication-problem pairs were identified that exceeded our confidence and support thresholds. An analysis of the top 500 pairs according to each measure of interestingness showed a high degree of accuracy for highly-ranked pairs.
CONCLUSION: The same technique was successfully employed at the University of Texas and accuracy was comparable to our previous results. Top associations included many medications that are highly specific for a particular problem as well as a large number of common, accurate medication-problem pairs that reflect practice patterns.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The field of clinical informatics has expanded substantially in the six decades since its inception. Early research focused on simple demonstrations that health information technology (HIT) such as electronic health records (EHRs), computerized provider order entry (CPOE), and clinical decision support (CDS) systems were feasible and potentially beneficial in clinical practice.
METHODS: In this review, we present recent evidence on clinical informatics in the United States covering three themes: 1) clinical informatics systems and interventions for providers, including EHRs, CPOE, CDS, and health information exchange; 2) consumer health informatics systems, including personal health records and web-based and mobile HIT; and 3) methods and governance for clinical informatics, including EHR usability; data mining, text mining, natural language processing, privacy, and security.
RESULTS: Substantial progress has been made in demonstrating that various clinical informatics methodologies and applications improve the structure, process, and outcomes of various facets of the healthcare system.
CONCLUSION: Over the coming years, much more will be expected from the field. As we move past the "early adopters" in Rogers' diffusion of innovations' curve through the "early majority" and into the "late majority," there will be a crucial need for new research methodologies and clinical applications that have been rigorously demonstrated to work (i.e., to improve health outcomes) in multiple settings with different types of patients and clinicians.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical knowledge bases of problem-medication pairs are necessary for many informatics solutions that improve patient safety, such as clinical summarization. However, developing these knowledge bases can be challenging.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to validate a previously developed crowdsourcing approach for generating a knowledge base of problem-medication pairs in a large, non-university health care system with a widely used, commercially available electronic health record.
METHODS: We first retrieved medications and problems entered in the electronic health record by clinicians during routine care during a six month study period. Following the previously published approach, we calculated the link frequency and link ratio for each pair then identified a threshold cutoff for estimated problem-medication pair appropriateness through clinician review; problem-medication pairs meeting the threshold were included in the resulting knowledge base. We selected 50 medications and their gold standard indications to compare the resulting knowledge base to the pilot knowledge base developed previously and determine its recall and precision.
RESULTS: The resulting knowledge base contained 26,912 pairs, had a recall of 62.3\% and a precision of 87.5\%, and outperformed the pilot knowledge base containing 11,167 pairs from the previous study, which had a recall of 46.9\% and a precision of 83.3\%.
CONCLUSIONS: We validated the crowdsourcing approach for generating a knowledge base of problem-medication pairs in a large non-university health care system with a widely used, commercially available electronic health record, indicating that the approach may be generalizable across healthcare settings and clinical systems. Further research is necessary to better evaluate the knowledge, to compare crowdsourcing with other approaches, and to evaluate if incorporating the knowledge into electronic health records improves patient outcomes.},

	doi = {10.1093/jamia/ocac089},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Complex interventions with multiple components and behavior change strategies are increasingly implemented as a form of clinical decision support (CDS) using native electronic health record functionality. Objectives of this study were, therefore, to (1) identify the proportion of randomized controlled trials with CDS interventions that were complex, (2) describe common gaps in the reporting of complexity in CDS research, and (3) determine the impact of increased complexity on CDS effectiveness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess CDS complexity and identify reporting gaps for characterizing CDS interventions, we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting tool for complex interventions. We evaluated the effect of increased complexity using random-effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Most included studies evaluated a complex CDS intervention (76\%). No studies described use of analytical frameworks or causal pathways. Two studies discussed use of theory but only one fully described the rationale and put it in context of a behavior change. A small but positive effect (standardized mean difference, 0.147; 95\% CI, 0.039-0.255; P \&lt; .01) in favor of increasing intervention complexity was observed.
DISCUSSION: While most CDS studies should classify interventions as complex, opportunities persist for documenting and providing resources in a manner that would enable CDS interventions to be replicated and adapted. Unless reporting of the design, implementation, and evaluation of CDS interventions improves, only slight benefits can be expected.
CONCLUSION: Conceptualizing CDS as complex interventions may help convey the careful attention that is needed to ensure these interventions are contextually and theoretically informed.},

Becoming an Age-Friendly Health System means that hospitals and health care systems reliably use a set of evidence-based practices known as the “4M’s” – What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility – to provide care for older, disabled and medically complex patients across all care settings. Implementing the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s (IHI) 4M’s Age-Friendly principles into primary care is challenging because there is no best practice to identify documentation of delivery. Leveraging the electronic health record (EHR) may automate this process. Age-Friendly principles for primary care were discussed at IHI peer coaching webinars, and PDSA cycles employed among clinic staff to define each of the 4M’s for the Vanderbilt Geriatric Practice: 1) Mentation – Mini-COG and PHQ2 extracted from nursing intake, 2) Medication – extracted from medication review, provider reconciliation, 3) Mobility – extracted from activities of daily living (ADL) mobility questions in nursing intake, and 4) What Matters Most – identifying patient portal messages. A dashboard within our EPIC electronic health record (EHR) was built based on these identified fields, allowing clinician drill-down to display more detail as needed. An operational dashboard for an EHR has potential to help inform clinician delivery of 4M’s care in the primary care setting.},

This study aimed to leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to optimize risk-prediction models and identify features most predictive of interstage mortality. This study utilized retrospective data from the National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative and included all patients who underwent stage I palliation and survived to hospital discharge (2008-2019). Multiple machine learning models were evaluated, including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting trees, extreme gradient boost trees, and light gradient boosting machines. A total of 3267 patients were included with 208 (6.4\%) interstage deaths. Machine learning models were trained on 180 clinical features. Digoxin use at discharge was the most influential factor resulting in a lower risk of interstage mortality (p {\textless} 0.0001). Stage I surgery with Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunt portended higher risk than Sano conduit (7.8\% vs 4.4\%, p = 0.0002). Non-modifiable risk factors identified with increased risk of interstage mortality included female sex, lower gestational age, and lower birth weight. Post-operative risk factors included the requirement of unplanned catheterization and more severe atrioventricular valve insufficiency at discharge. Light gradient boosting machines demonstrated the best performance with an area under the receiver operative characteristic curve of 0.642. Advanced machine learning algorithms highlight a number of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for interstage mortality following stage I palliation. However, model performance remains modest, suggesting the presence of unmeasured confounders that contribute to interstage risk.},

	abstract = {This study seeks to evaluate the recurrence of kidney stones (ROKS) nomogram for risk stratification of recurrence in a retrospective study. To do this, we analyzed the performance of the 2018 ROKS nomogram in a case-control study of 200 patients (100 with and 100 without subsequent recurrence). All patients underwent kidney stone surgery between 2013 and 2015 and had at least 5 years of follow-up. We evaluated ROKS performance for prediction of recurrence at 2- and 5-year via area under the receiver operating curve (ROC-AUC). Specifically, we assessed the nomogram's potential for stratifying patients based on low or high risk of recurrence at: a) an optimized cutoff threshold (i.e., optimized for both sensitivity and specificity), and b) a sensitive cutoff threshold (i.e., high sensitivity (0.80) and low specificity). We found fair performance of the nomogram for recurrence prediction at 2 and 5 years (ROC-AUC of 0.67 and 0.63, respectively). At the optimized cutoff threshold, recurrence rates for the low and high-risk groups were 20 and 45\% at 2 years, and 50 and 70\% at 5 years, respectively. At the sensitive cutoff threshold, the corresponding recurrence rates for the low and high-risk groups were of 16 and 38\% at 2 years, and 42 and 66\% at 5 years, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a recurrence-free advantage between the groups for both cutoff thresholds (p {\textless} 0.01, Fig. 2). Therefore, we believe that the ROKS nomogram could facilitate risk stratification for stone recurrence and adherence to risk-based surveillance protocols.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Most care for early CKD is provided in primary care, including hypertension (HTN) management. Computerized clinical decision support (CDS) can improve the quality of care for CKD but can also cause alert fatigue for primary care physicians (PCPs). Computable phenotypes (CPs) are algorithms to identify disease populations using, for example, specific laboratory data criteria.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine the feasibility of implementation of CDS alerts by developing CPs and estimating potential alert burden.
METHODS: We utilized clinical guidelines to develop a set of five CPs for patients with stage 3 to 4 CKD, uncontrolled HTN, and indications for initiation or titration of guideline-recommended antihypertensive agents. We then conducted an iterative data analytic process consisting of database queries, data validation, and subject matter expert discussion, to make iterative changes to the CPs. We estimated the potential alert burden to make final decisions about the scope of the CDS alerts. Specifically, the number of times that each alert could fire was limited to once per patient.
RESULTS: In our primary care network, there were 239,339 encounters for 105,992 primary care patients between April 1, 2018 and April 1, 2019. Of these patients, 9,081 (8.6\%) had stage 3 and 4 CKD. Almost half of the CKD patients, 4,191 patients, also had uncontrolled HTN. The majority of CKD patients were female, elderly, white, and English-speaking. We estimated that 5,369 alerts would fire if alerts were triggered multiple times per patient, with a mean number of alerts shown to each PCP ranging from 0.07-to 0.17 alerts per week.
CONCLUSION: Development of CPs and estimation of alert burden allows researchers to iteratively fine-tune CDS prior to implementation. This method of assessment can help organizations balance the tradeoff between standardization of care and alert fatigue.},
